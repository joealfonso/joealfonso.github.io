										Joseph Alfonso is an interaction and user experience designer who lives to work and plays while working.

								 	<p class="aboutTopParagraph">
									Here's a brief summary of what I'm about; I'll save the longer story for after. This is where I'm a little more casual and have some fun writing about myself.
									</p>

									<h3>Philosophy</h3>
									<p>
									I don't work as hard as I do to earn a paycheck. First of all, i've done too much to get where I am, and if I just wanted money, I would be wasting everything I've accomplished. I work to be fulfilled as a designer and as a person. As designers, and especially with interaction designers, we have the ability and responsibility to do more than just make things look pretty. No matter what the project is, at the conclusion of it, one of my goals is always to result in the user's life being a little bit better or easier. Almost every day we overlook so many little interactions and experiences that I want to make the one's I work on result in the user's day being a little bit better and more fulfilled after.
									<br>
									I'm also a very big advocate of reading and writing in my free time. As a designer, I am really in "client services" which means I not only create pretty visuals, I gather information and data, create solutions, pitch work, sell myself, and work my hardest to find the most appropriate and educated way to solve problems. In order to be the excel at these services I need to practice how I write and communicate by educating myself in literature and writing.
								</p>
									<br>
									<!-- <h3>The Blinker Theory</h3>
									I don't want to come across as pretentious or as if I'm creating industry theories, but the "Blinker Theory" is how I explain what big things can result from little changes. It's a strong influence in my general design philosophy. I elaborate more on this is a blog post, so I will keep this brief.
									<br>
									Attention to detail with smalls thing such as the sound of a blinker can result in big changes. Every single design element on any product, in any application, on anything at all that communicates to a sense is done with a reason. When creating a car especially, everything is done with a purpose, so why not create a blinker sound that's a little more pleasurable to listen to? 
									<br>
									A more pleasurable blinker sound would lead to a more rewarding experience for using it. This would give drivers more incentive to use it, resulting in reduced stress for drivers as a whole. It would also ease people in traffic. Think about sitting in a traffic jam with your blinker on waiting to change lanes. Just hearing the constant click clack that most cars have. Why not reduce the drivers stress just a tiny bit? Again, more incentive to use your blinker.
									<br><br> -->	
									<h3>Down Time</h3>
									<p>
									Design, design, design and more design, right?! No. I'm a firm believer that we need to allow ourselves to get away from design in order to get MORE inspiration. Looking at other designs and reading article will only get someone so far. I like to find design in all of the other activities I do so I am able to create original ideas based off of my own experiences no one else has.
									<br>
									I'm a huge Boston Bruins fan, and hockey in general. I enjoy traveling and camping in specific, especially creating survival kits and bug out bags. I enjoy reading books by bouncing back and forth between a non-fiction and then fiction book. Writing is very important to me as i keep a (almost) daily design journal and constant outlines of ideas for articles and blog entries about my industry experiences and thoughts. Furthering my knowledge in technology and computers is also a very strong passion of mine. I build my own computer in order to save money and learn, and this results in the majority of my work being done in, wait for it... Windows! I would say my time is a 70/30 split between working in Windows and Apple OS's.
