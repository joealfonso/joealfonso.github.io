            <p>I was the lead designer for Amazon’s Employee Document Management (EDM) tool which supports 4.8 billion
              documents and counting for employees in 67 countries. It is a critical system for managing documents
              across their vast potential and current workforce including candidates, employees, alumni, students, and
              more. Furthermore, EDM replaced an older software service with an accessible web application, saving
              Amazon well over $7 million annually in contracts and extensions. </p>

              <p>Employee Document Management empowers a wide range of users including candidates, employees, alumni,
                and students, to efficiently and securely manage, generate, and execute their documents on any device
                throughout their time with Amazon and after as well. Furthermore, on the administrative side, HR can
                leverage EDM for comprehensive document lifecycle management, including compliance, distribution, legal
                support, and country specific template management. EDM simplifies document sharing across all stages of
                the employment journey, fostering a more efficient, easy to use, and delightful document experience for
                enterprise and user solutions.</p>
              <p>Amazon relied on a third party contractor for document management which lead to fragmented and
                error-prone products resulting in frustrating experience for both Admins and employees. The impacts were
                spread across multiple systems and databases causing errors at all points of the employment life cycle.
                Our team set out to launching in-house first party document solution that would be fully integrated into
                the end-to-end lifecycle for employment documents.</p>

                <p>Document management is not just about documents, but also about the people who use them and the context in which they operate. This concept was a key driver behind the creation of Amazon's initial first-party solution for document management, designed for both users and administrators.</p>
                  <p>Everyone applying for an opportunity deserves an accessible, trustworthy, and top-quality experience. This approach allows Amazon not only to evaluate but also to scale its services, ensuring that a world-class experience remains so.</p>

                acting as a liaison among UX, engineering, product management, and other stakeholders and vendors.
                Collaborating with researchers and defining research strategies to get the most out of a limited system
                was critical as we had to be as efficient as possible. In addition, as part of project planning, I

                      <p class="margin-top-md">Designing the Document Portal experience for a product that I used myself was a really fun and exciting experience. It was something that I could go to 100% of the people I worked with, and whether I knew them or not, we could have a conversation about the experience. This lead to many really interesting explorations into the document experience as a whole for humans in general. Getting to know and understand how facility employees work is always something I enjoy doing, so I made sure to reach out and visit with various hourly employees as well in order to understand their unique challenges.</p>
                      <p>One of obstacles I came across while designign the experience was the lack of information that coudl be presented often for security reasons. No preview images of documents, no personal information and a general lack of content made creating engaging but also meaningful elements for representing documents fairly challening. I leaned on a new date requirement system that I cover in another part of this case study.. Technically only two specific documents needed to be signed to legally work, but we can't tell people that information.</p>
                      <p>Something I found extremely interesting was the required date dynamic. Once a document had passed the "required" date, users generally diregarded them. We had one person request us to remove the documents as they were bothering them! </p>
                      <blockquote class="text-md text-center line-height-md margin-bottom-md">Can you remove the overdue documents? They're distracting"</blockquote>
                      <p>For this reason, we removed the literal date, since the farther a person was from the date, the less important the document became, and just had a general overdue label.</p>

              <p>I didn’t want to just solve problems, I aimed to understand the most effective way to articulate why my
                solution addresses those issues compellingly, fostering agreement and gaining support to move forward. A
                countless number of people are involved in the designs process depending on the stage, scope, timing,
                and a number of other factors and it was up to me to make sure we could be as effective as possible no
                matter the audience or setting.</p>
              <p>After meeting the team and anyone handing off work to me I set off to talk with the prior design and
                research team to get a hold of any research and information. I would end up bothering them for a very
                long time slowly gathering pieces and parts while putting together my own investigation in ways of
                gathering and making sense for not only myself, but for the rest of the team as well. My findings were
                going to be there's as well.</p>
              <p>Some of the work I inherited were Heuristic evaluations, usability test, SUS scores, and every known
                persona and journey form pre-hire to alumni. All of these research meant I could focus my time on
                studying and benchmarking instead of doing the initial evaluations. We could evaluate performance of

              <p>To grasp the scope of existing work, research, and knowledge, I started a comprehensive review process
                of evaluating what information we already had so I could understand the current situation better than
                anyone as the goal. The first few months were occupied with intensive interviews with the previous team,
                extensive examination of existing documentation, and frequent sync-ups with project managers to gather
                all pertinent information.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, much of this invaluable work had not been previously shared with this specific team. It
                was a great opportunity for everyone to get a fresh and more critical look at the work they’ve been
                doing. It was there, just not socialized to a very relevant group of people. This not only saved
                research time, but also created an environment where we were all on the same page and learning together.
                Everyone understood together and there was much less “but I thought” conversation happening.</p>
              <p>By leveraging available information, we were able to expedite a three-year plan and prioritize tasks
                more effectively. The early integration of design provided a platform for all teams to collaborate
                efficiently. Prior to this, the process was fragmented and lacked an effective way to consolidate,
                align, and advance together. Now, with a centralized repository for our designs, we could hold ideas and
                facilitate asynchronous conversations more effectively.</p>
              <p>Transforming this analysis into a roadmap allowed each team to provide precise estimates, taking into
                account all contextual factors, leading to a significant decrease in planning uncertainties. By
                delivering UX work ahead of development, we could accommodate inevitable adjustments and effectively
                manage multiple concurrent work streams.</p>

                      people all the way down.</p>
    
                    <p>The initial discussions grounded in research, along with various organizational prioritization
                      meetings, ensured that UX held a substantial role in the decision-making process. This beneficial
                      context allowed me to work independently, without the need to divide my responsibilities to many
                      times.</p>
                    <p>With everyone on the team now sharing a unified understanding, I was able to facilitate workshops to
                      gather sufficient information for informed decision-making. Collaboratively, we developed both current
                      and future user journeys as well as story maps. This was achieved by merging our internal
                      understanding and user knowledge, which together painted a comprehensive picture of both the perceived
                      and backend user experiences</p>
                    <p>During these sessions, we focused on creating a comprehensive view of the employee document
                      experience, including tab and context switching. Most services were distributed across various tools
                      depending on the needs of the HR representative.</p>

                    </ul>
    
    
                    <p>While developing the user journeys, we recorded screenshots, notes, journey paths, and time spent on
                      each relevant task. This allowed us to establish benchmarks for measuring the impact of changes. It
                      also highlighted the various factors and the scope influenced by these roles, leading us to discover
                      new teams for collaboration and communication.</p>
    
                    <h2>Automating document storage workflows</h2>
                    <p>One of the really interesting things I realized while working on this projects is the fact that while
                      the concept of a digital files is simple enough, where it's stored is an extremely important
                      requirement. It's one of those things that make you realize how concepts like where a file is stored
                      is often taken for granted. As we started to dig into requirements it was very clear that we had to
                      establish some type of logic based system where rules are applied leveraging attributes and system
                      information in ordert to automate many of these tasks. Converting thousands of manually created rules
                      that determined which employee received which documents was a monster of a task that revealed just how
                      different each country can be. For example, Germany has a Work Councils, that by concept offer better
                      treatment for employees, but that also require wet (physical) signatures in a digital age.</p>

              <p>To grasp the scope of existing work, research, and knowledge, I started a comprehensive review
                process of evaluating what information we already had so I could understand the current situation
                better than anyone as the goal. The first few months were occupied with intensive interviews with the
                previous team, extensive examination of existing documentation, and frequent sync-ups with project
                managers to gather all pertinent information.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, much of this invaluable work had not been previously shared with this specific team.
                It was a great opportunity for everyone to get a fresh and more critical look at the work they’ve been
                doing. It was there, just not socialized to a very relevant group of people. This not only saved
                research time, but also created an environment where we were all on the same page and learning
                together. Everyone understood together and there was much less “but I thought” conversation happening.
              </p>
              <p>By leveraging available information, we were able to expedite a three-year plan and prioritize tasks
                more effectively. The early integration of design provided a platform for all teams to collaborate
                efficiently. Prior to this, the process was fragmented and lacked an effective way to consolidate,
                align, and advance together. Now, with a centralized repository for our designs, we could hold ideas
                and facilitate asynchronous conversations more effectively.</p>
              <p>Transforming this analysis into a roadmap allowed each team to provide precise estimates, taking into
                account all contextual factors, leading to a significant decrease in planning uncertainties. By
                delivering UX work ahead of development, we could accommodate inevitable adjustments and effectively
                manage multiple concurrent work streams.</p>

              <p>The development phase of our project held significant value and importance. Primarily, it was an
                instrumental period that provided an opportunity to enhance the operational procedures for the new
                team. It served as a pivotal point where all efforts, strategies, and plans culminated into an
                actionable process. During this phase, every team member was actively involved, contributing their
                specific skills and expertise, and working collaboratively to ensure the success of the project. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, this was the phase where we could establish open communication and dialogue with our
                users. It was during this time that we could put our product to the test, identify areas of
                improvement, and incorporate user feedback into our development process. This interactive process did
                not only result in a significant improvement in the quality of our product, but it also facilitated
                the development of lasting relationships with our administrative users users.</p>
              <p>These relationships have proven invaluable, as the individuals we connected with during the
                development phase continue to provide us with insightful and constructive feedback from their
                respective teams. Their continued involvement and willingness to share their experiences with our

              <p>After establishing a comprehensive plan, we took advantage of these progressive launches, treating each as an opportunity to conduct User Acceptance Tests (UATs). Executing UATs in small, real-world groups allowed us to gather valuable feedback and insights into the usability and functionality of the tool. This strategic approach was designed to ensure that the vast majority of the users, who represented the primary populations, received a thoroughly vetted and tested user experience.</p>
              <p>Following the initial launch, we would conduct a rigorous round of bug fixing. This consisted of internal bug bashing sessions (a HUGE thank you to the development team if they ever see this) in addition to feedback sessions in the various geographic regions as the groups of countries were launched.  Any remaining issues, whether minor or significant, were promptly addressed. If the problems couldn't be resolved immediately, they were scheduled as a fast-follow task or added to our backlog for future attention. This method ensured that we were constantly refining and improving the user experience, even after the product was live.</p>
              <p>An important aspect to consider was that our launches were always phased due to various country-specific limitations. These limitations often resulted in multiple mini-product launches. While this method fragmented the launch process, it was necessary to accommodate the differing requirements and regulations of each country.</p>
              <p>This phased approach had a dual impact. On one hand, it simplified each individual launch by reducing the scope and scale of each phase. On the other hand, it could occasionally elevate cognitive and operational strain. The process of coordinating and managing multiple mini-launches could be challenging and required careful planning and organization.</p>
              <p>Despite the challenges, this approach proved beneficial. It allowed us to adapt and respond to user feedback in real-time and ensured that each user group received a thoroughly tested and refined user experience. It also allowed us to continually refine and improve our product, ensuring that we delivered the highest quality tool to our users.</p>

            <p>Throughout the project, I noticed a recurring theme: the relationship between people and documents. The existing software permitted admins to search only by exact person IDs or documents, which was not entirely logical.</p>
            <p>In our research, we emphasized this theme and made some intriguing discoveries. We found that different attributes and filters are crucial for people and documents. Furthermore, we realized that a document does not exist without a person, reinforcing the human aspect of document management.</p>

                      <p class="margin-top-md">Conflicting perceptions of documents and files led to vocabulary challenges in Employee Document Management (EDM). It was essential to standardize language and account for exceptions to rules or standards to ensure scalability. For instance, document collection requests, classified as documents, also make requests and contain other documents, all of which could appear individually in a search.</p>
                      <p>Initially, conflicting mental models of what documents and files are led to vocabulary challenges, especially among administrators and users. This confusion was not limited to internal debates.</p>
                      <p>Discussions also arose about the distinctions between documents and files, and how files within documents were perceived as items on a computer during upload processes. It was crucial to establish a standardized language and vocabulary.</p>
                      <p>We had to compensate for specific cases that violated rules or standards, ensuring we could scale gracefully in unexpected ways. For example, consider document collection requests. These items are classified as documents, but they are a type of document that also makes requests and contains other documents. Remember, during a search, all of these documents could appear individually in a document search due to the structure we modeled based on our best insights.</p>
