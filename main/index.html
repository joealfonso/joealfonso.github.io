          <p>I was the lead designer for Amazon’s Employee Document Management (EDM) tool which supports 4.8 billion
            documents and counting for employees in 67 countries. It is a critical system for managing documents
            across their vast potential and current workforce including candidates, employees, alumni, students, and
            more. Furthermore, EDM replaced an older software service with an accessible web application, saving
            Amazon well over $7 million annually in contracts and extensions. </p>

                throughout their time with Amazon and after as well. Furthermore, on the administrative side, HR can
                leverage EDM for comprehensive document lifecycle management, including compliance, distribution, legal
                support, and country specific template management. EDM simplifies document sharing across all stages of
                the employment journey, fostering a more efficient, easy to use, and delightful document experience for
                enterprise and user solutions.</p>
              <p>Amazon relied on a third party contractor for document management which lead to fragmented and
                error-prone products resulting in frustrating experience for both Admins and employees. The impacts were
                spread across multiple systems and databases causing errors at all points of the employment life cycle.
                Our team set out to launching in-house first party document solution that would be fully integrated into
                the end-to-end lifecycle for employment documents.</p>

              <p>I didn’t want to just solve problems, I aimed to understand the most effective way to articulate why my
                solution addresses those issues compellingly, fostering agreement and gaining support to move forward. A
                countless number of people are involved in the designs process depending on the stage, scope, timing,
                and a number of other factors and it was up to me to make sure we could be as effective as possible no
                matter the audience or setting.</p>
              <p>After meeting the team and anyone handing off work to me I set off to talk with the prior design and
                research team to get a hold of any research and information. I would end up bothering them for a very
                long time slowly gathering pieces and parts while putting together my own investigation in ways of
                gathering and making sense for not only myself, but for the rest of the team as well. My findings were
                going to be there's as well.</p>
              <p>Some of the work I inherited were Heuristic evaluations, usability test, SUS scores, and every known
                persona and journey form pre-hire to alumni. All of these research meant I could focus my time on
                studying and benchmarking instead of doing the initial evaluations. We could evaluate performance of
                changes right away.</p>

              <p>To grasp the scope of existing work, research, and knowledge, I started a comprehensive review process
                of evaluating what information we already had so I could understand the current situation better than
                anyone as the goal. The first few months were occupied with intensive interviews with the previous team,
                extensive examination of existing documentation, and frequent sync-ups with project managers to gather
                all pertinent information.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, much of this invaluable work had not been previously shared with this specific team. It
                was a great opportunity for everyone to get a fresh and more critical look at the work they’ve been
                doing. It was there, just not socialized to a very relevant group of people. This not only saved
                research time, but also created an environment where we were all on the same page and learning together.
                Everyone understood together and there was much less “but I thought” conversation happening.</p>
              <p>By leveraging available information, we were able to expedite a three-year plan and prioritize tasks
                more effectively. The early integration of design provided a platform for all teams to collaborate
                efficiently. Prior to this, the process was fragmented and lacked an effective way to consolidate,
                align, and advance together. Now, with a centralized repository for our designs, we could hold ideas and
                facilitate asynchronous conversations more effectively.</p>
              <p>Transforming this analysis into a roadmap allowed each team to provide precise estimates, taking into
                account all contextual factors, leading to a significant decrease in planning uncertainties. By
                delivering UX work ahead of development, we could accommodate inevitable adjustments and effectively
                manage multiple concurrent work streams.</p>

                <p>Document management is about documents, sure, but those documents don't have a pupose to exist
                  without people. The people working and the people governing the countries they work within. It's
                  people all the way down.</p>

                <p>The initial discussions grounded in research, along with various organizational prioritization
                  meetings, ensured that UX held a substantial role in the decision-making process. This beneficial
                  context allowed me to work independently, without the need to divide my responsibilities to many
                  times.</p>
                <p>With everyone on the team now sharing a unified understanding, I was able to facilitate workshops to
                  gather sufficient information for informed decision-making. Collaboratively, we developed both current
                  and future user journeys as well as story maps. This was achieved by merging our internal
                  understanding and user knowledge, which together painted a comprehensive picture of both the perceived
                  and backend user experiences</p>
                <p>During these sessions, we focused on creating a comprehensive view of the employee document
                  experience, including tab and context switching. Most services were distributed across various tools
                  depending on the needs of the HR representative.</p>



                <ul class="bg-primary bg-opacity-10% padding-md border-left border-3 border-primary list list--ul">
                  <li>What was the current experience like?</li>
                  <li>Biggest points of frustration and issue?</li>
                  <li>What were needs not being met?</li>
                  <li>Which jobs to be done needed to be accounted for weren’t being addressed?</li>
                  <li>Once we had a universal understanding of the experience we were ready to define and plan.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>While developing the user journeys, we recorded screenshots, notes, journey paths, and time spent on
                  each relevant task. This allowed us to establish benchmarks for measuring the impact of changes. It
                  also highlighted the various factors and the scope influenced by these roles, leading us to discover
                  new teams for collaboration and communication.</p>

                <h2>Automating document storage workflows</h2>
                <p>One of the really interesting things I realized while working on this projects is the fact that while
                  the concept of a digital files is simple enough, where it's stored is an extremely important
                  requirement. It's one of those things that make you realize how concepts like where a file is stored
                  is often taken for granted. As we started to dig into requirements it was very clear that we had to
                  establish some type of logic based system where rules are applied leveraging attributes and system
                  information in ordert to automate many of these tasks. Converting thousands of manually created rules
                  that determined which employee received which documents was a monster of a task that revealed just how
                  different each country can be. For example, Germany has a Work Councils, that by concept offer better
                  treatment for employees, but that also require wet (physical) signatures in a digital age.</p>

                <p>To grasp the scope of existing work, research, and knowledge, I started a comprehensive review
                  process of evaluating what information we already had so I could understand the current situation
                  better than anyone as the goal. The first few months were occupied with intensive interviews with the
                  previous team, extensive examination of existing documentation, and frequent sync-ups with project
                  managers to gather all pertinent information.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, much of this invaluable work had not been previously shared with this specific team.
                  It was a great opportunity for everyone to get a fresh and more critical look at the work they’ve been
                  doing. It was there, just not socialized to a very relevant group of people. This not only saved
                  research time, but also created an environment where we were all on the same page and learning
                  together. Everyone understood together and there was much less “but I thought” conversation happening.
                </p>
                <p>By leveraging available information, we were able to expedite a three-year plan and prioritize tasks
                  more effectively. The early integration of design provided a platform for all teams to collaborate
                  efficiently. Prior to this, the process was fragmented and lacked an effective way to consolidate,
                  align, and advance together. Now, with a centralized repository for our designs, we could hold ideas
                  and facilitate asynchronous conversations more effectively.</p>
                <p>Transforming this analysis into a roadmap allowed each team to provide precise estimates, taking into
                  account all contextual factors, leading to a significant decrease in planning uncertainties. By
                  delivering UX work ahead of development, we could accommodate inevitable adjustments and effectively
                  manage multiple concurrent work streams.</p>

                <p>The development phase of our project held significant value and importance. Primarily, it was an
                  instrumental period that provided an opportunity to enhance the operational procedures for the new
                  team. It served as a pivotal point where all efforts, strategies, and plans culminated into an
                  actionable process. During this phase, every team member was actively involved, contributing their
                  specific skills and expertise, and working collaboratively to ensure the success of the project. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, this was the phase where we could establish open communication and dialogue with our
                  users. It was during this time that we could put our product to the test, identify areas of
                  improvement, and incorporate user feedback into our development process. This interactive process did
                  not only result in a significant improvement in the quality of our product, but it also facilitated
                  the development of lasting relationships with our administrative users users.</p>
                <p>These relationships have proven invaluable, as the individuals we connected with during the
                  development phase continue to provide us with insightful and constructive feedback from their
                  respective teams. Their continued involvement and willingness to share their experiences with our
                  product have greatly contributed to the quality of the product being delivered.</p>
