                  <h1>High Concept</h1>
              
                  <p>Employee Document Management empowers a wide range of users including candidates, employees, alumni, and students, to efficiently and securely manage, generate, and execute their documents on any device throughout their time with Amazon and after as well. Furthermore, on the administrative side, HR can leverage EDM for comprehensive document lifecycle management, including compliance, distribution, legal support, and country specific template management. EDM simplifies document sharing across all stages of the employment journey, fostering a more efficient, easy to use, and delightful document experience for enterprise and user solutions.</p>
              
                  <p>Amazon relied on a third party contractor for document management which lead to fragmented and error-prone products resulting in frustrating experience for both Admins and employees. The impacts were spread across multiple systems and databases causing errors at all points of the employment life cycle. Our team set out to launching in-house first party document solution that would be fully integrated into the end-to-end lifecycle for employment documents.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><Strong>Persona group 1: HR Admins and Enterprise Partners</Strong></li>
                    <ul>
                     <li>Deprecate the current third-party document management software suite</li>
                     <li>Reduce person-hours required by a certain amount for specific document management tasks</li>
                    </ul>
                     <li><Strong>Persona group 2: Employees, candidates, students, alumni, contractors</Strong></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Provide a world class experience for people seeking career within Amazon</li>
                      <li>Provide employees an easier to find and use document and self-service experiences</li>
                      <li>Create a more trustworthy experience by keping the entire hiring and employee journey 100% first party</li>

                  <h1>My Role</h1>
              
                  <p>My role for this product was multi-faceted and spanned all child products and experiences, encompassing various aspects of UX design, research, project management, and supervising UX deliverables for the project, making sure they met both deadlines and quality standards. I advocated assertive but collaborative UX integration, aligning with both user needs and business objectives in addition to acting as a liaison among UX, engineering, product management, and other stakeholders and vendors. Collaborating with researchers and defining research strategies to get the most out of a limited system was critical as we had to be as efficient as possible. In addition, as part of project planning, I ensured the seamless integration of UX activities with the overall development and progressive launch schedule over multiple countries. They also proactively identified potential UX obstacles and devised strategies to counteract them.</p>
              
                  <p My scope spanned not only the parent product of Employee Document Management, but also each child product and service, such as Document Generation, the entire employee experience, bulk admin actions the general administrative experience.</p>
