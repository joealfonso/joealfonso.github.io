       <p class="summary">Me? I'm just another duck on the pond. <br><br>
         
        Someone I work with once called me a "positive disruptor" and it really resonated with me. I try to make changes, lead, and advocate for healthy, collaborative, and productive teams. 
      </p>
      <p>Before we get real deep here... in addition to the information you can find on my website, and also on my resume, I specialize in cost-effective team operations, research, and user-centered design. I understand what it takes to operate an in-person and remote team in regards of commitment, organization, software and hardware, and group dynamics- with a focus on enhancing a team's strengths and improving on their weaknesses. Furthermore, as a result of security concerns within schools and education in general, I've explored solutions ranging from mailing specially selected cameras to users in order to operate within legal guidelines to leveraging the newest design tools to track the mouse movement of eight users at once.</p>
      
       <p>This part of the site is always a challenge for me. Balancing confidence and humbleness is something I struggle with. At the end of the day I help teams and projects raise their level of quality by leading, demonstrating, collaborating, and generally just getting shit done.</p>
       <p>I take great pride in teaching and mentoring new professionals to the industry and I feel it's our responsibility as designers and people in general to pass on and share our experiences so that others can have even better opportunities than we did.</p>
