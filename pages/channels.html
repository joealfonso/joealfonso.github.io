    <p>When the drag and drop interactions were introduced we often found users playing with them on their free time or during research sessions when waiting. It was this little interaction that was similar to clicking the top of a pen. Just a little action that served as a way for users to find comfort and occupy time just because they enjoyed how it felt. In later interactions the drag and drop interaction was improved to raise and skew a little on rotation in order to create a more playful experience and stronger interaction affordance</p>

In the end it depending on the situation. If we were testing something specific to personalization we often had to create unique experience for each user which then impacted our organization and workflow system since we now had to account for versions like we hadn't done prior.</p>
         <p>If we were testing a something that wasn't directly related to persoanlization then it woudl depend on how much the experience was influenced.

        <p class="summary">The old home experience had serious usability and engagement issues. By gathering user feedback, analytics, and the current product suite and company transition, we were able to create a new landing experience for post-login users that increased engagement frequency and scope of products.</p>
        <p>The first job to be done was obtaining any research and any analytics that existed. Using Google Analytics and a newly implemented tool called Pendo we were able to organize that while conducting usability and satisfaction research. Gathering usage data and funnels were very useful for the data itself and it also enabled us to identify any potential patterns to be aware of when running research sessions.</p>

          <p>After years of tinkering and in the light of recent software developments, I've developed a very
            cost-effective remote user research solution that we leveraged to get timely, digestable, and actionable data.
            By having assumptions, analytics, and a general awareness of user concerns, it took less than a week to
            facilitate and extract findings that were immediately integrated into prototypes and planing. Our primary
            Methods included remote moderated and unmoderated usability testing, 1:1 interviews, and almost always surveys as follow-ups to
            studies and as their own studies. This combination of generative and evaluative research was critical in
            discovering and analyzing users' behavior, need, and motivations.</p>

          <p>When evaluating the performance of the old home experience we needed two things: 1) we needed to know what
            would save users time, and 2) we needed a set of goals that could guide the experience and metrics determined
            to result in a successful product. The following were some of our high-level conclusions that were most
            relevant to our goals.

          also inundated with certain users and content due to a weak sorting and throttling algorithm.

      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Not Engaging and Lacked Customization</h5>
        <p>We found that users rarely strayed from certain areas of the site regardless of the content on their

          settings.

      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Users using direct URLs and Bookmarks</h5>
        <p>Analytics showed that often users would use direct bookmarks to certain areas of the site which they found
          most valuable. This resulted in Home being the least used page of product langins pages and also reduced
          product diversity each user engaged with.

        <p class="summary">Prototypes iterations were based off of both research and evaluation of the old homepage, and also had to take into account all of the new experiences and goals. As a result, instead of being fast short iterations, homepage consists of a longer, but less dense timeline staging the final release.</p>
       <p>Instead of early quick revisions, the new homepage experience was done over time and changed as the experience itself changed. Home has a separate research track that rans in parallel with others since home was often the step prior to a user engaging with other parts of the site but we weren't finishing it until the rest of the site was done.</p>
       <p>It was important to establish goals early on in the process and identify guiding principles for research and design so that research is more valuable and to avoid doing unnecessary research that wastes time and money. It's also important in regards to research because I was able to provide templates for each project that were consistent enough to be facilitated by anyone on the team. What this means is that we could have different people collecting, at different times but all returning relatively the same type of information. This enabled quicker synthesization and integration of research and opportunities that were out of scope were easier to identify and delegate. </p>

Long term researouch found that visuals, if done poorly, actually slow users down. It took a great effort by the content team to work with us in order to accomodate meaningful imagery that was an indication of content and not just a design element.</p>

       <p>We invested heavily in the fact that users have many modes and we won't be able to predict which mode they'll arrive in. Making sure that users were aware and had quick access to any path was imperative to us. Bouncing and pogo-sticking back to the home page like users used to do was unacceptable. With the integration of the global navigation, the home experience is with the users throughout. But only what they need, not the content. Just the ability to access the content.

     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Onboarding and Personalization</h2>
     <p class="summary">We carefully empowered users to create and own their Discovery Education experience and collaborated with a number of teams to offer direct support through a number of channels.</p>
     
     <p>Early on in our soft-launch timeline we identified that we were struggling to get users to complete the initial onboarding screen forms. In order for users to have the best experience, and have the most relevant content served to them, we needed to know more about each user. We also want to remind users about settings they might have forgotten about and enable them to make any adjustments to make the most out of the transition to a new product.     
     </p> <p>What started out as a three screen experience ended up being just one page with the plan to replace it all together for a much leaner and less intrusive experience. Initially the intentions were good; allow users the ability the refresh and set up their profiles. Due to a number of reasons we explored with users, the immediate value just wasn't communicated or implemented well enough.
      
     </p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Iterative Improvement</h5>
     <p>The initial prototype called for three on-boarding screens. With less than stellar performance we reduced the experience to two screens and immediately noticed an improvement </p>

     <article class="span-col-12"><p>
       With performance still below where we wanted it to be we again reduced the flow to a single screen, and again, noticed an improvement. We saw an especially large increase in mobile users making selections. We found out that it was easier to see that there was an additional content and as a result users were more likely to scroll.

              Eventually we concluded that we will remove the experience and direct the user to their profile instead also supported the fact that we could adjust the onboarding to assist in other areas in addition to be a less intrusive experience overall.
           </p></article>
    
     <article class="span-col-12">
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Battling Prior Mental Models</h5>
     <p>One of the key reasons teachers were skipping the screens was because of the unawareness of an experience they were already used to changing. This was different than something new. users already had mental models and assumptions about their profile and the options they selected. They weren't used to them doing much and continued to assume the same thing.</p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Minimize Interruption</h5>
     <p>A critical issue we dealt with was trying to reach teachers and users prior to using the experience. We wanted to establish a voice with users to speak to them and explain exactly why we're asking for their time. The last thing a teacher needs is an additional interruption, never mind one that result in an entire experience change. The less prepared and exposed a teacher was, the increased likelihood that they would skip the onboarding experience.</p>

     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Unique Challenges</h2>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Similar Provisioned Products</h5>
     <p>The product suite for Discovery Education is large enough, but the number of provisioned product and services that districts and users can purchase plus the combinations they make are almost endless. This also results in certain products look very similar to other products and sub-products.</p>
       </article>
       <figure class="span-col-6">

       </figure>
       <article class="span-col-12">
     <p>Prior to this new experience, products were usually recognized by the text alone. Now, with the design system set on a more engaging experience, we needed to create system solutions that weren't in place before. We need to work with the content team to obtain and generate images for each product. This required a whole new sub-project for the team to focus and delegate time towards but in the end resulted in an experience that was much more scannable and easier to understand.</p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Not interrupting class time</h5>
     <p>Reducing the number of screens and effort required to engage with the experience for the first time wasn't just to increase conversions. One of the more consistent pieces of feedback we received was about class interruption for students and teachers. Even when expecting it, users generally were only signed in during times they had a task to complete or something to do. Generally, they were signed in to do something and any stopping that is seen as an interruption</p>
     <p>By reducing the on-boarding experience and working with the Marketing and Community teams much more proactively, we were able to reduce friction, increase engagement with the profile customization, and increase general satisfaction ratings.</p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Providing contextual support</h5>
     <p>One of the major improvements with the new experience was our new in-product messaging, support, and analytics system. We established three goals we needed to accomodate for when exploring solutions. It had to be accessible, contextual, and explorable. The user had to be able to easily access help at any time in the experience. The help they access should be contextual and present information about the current experience initially. Research has shown that users tend to want specific support related to what they're current ask is over general support. And lastly, if the user wasn't able to find a solution, they should have other options such as related content or a way to directly reach out for support.</p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Customization, Personalization, and Security Infrastructure</h5>
     <p>Figuring out how we would leverage user data to create better experiences require thorough planning that would influence the entire data schema of each person's profile. We had to account for what was currently available, what we would be collecting, what we COULD be collecting in the distant future, technology limitations, optimizations, and especially security. Security was an additional challenge because all times we were required to abstract an anonymize each user's information. When we wanted to access a user's information, we had to go through additional steps to identify them while retaining anonymity. </p>

       <p>A common theme we encountered during research was the fact that most users assumed personalization and customization. Time and time again, when testing experiences, teachers had assumptions about how the experience would be personalized for them.</p>
       <p>It wasn't just that users wanted personalization, they assumed and expected it. The fact that this was such a widely observed theme, this quickly elevated certain features and experiences that were relevant to personalization and customization.</p>

It was this little interaction that was similar to clicking the top of a pen. Just a little action that served as a way for users to find comfort and occupy time just because they enjoyed how it felt. In later interactions the drag and drop interaction was improved to raise and skew a little on rotation in order to create a more playful experience and stronger interaction affordance</p>

            <p>With the focus of the experience being so focused on personalization, an interest challenge had presented itself. How close to the real thing do we need to get when testing experiences? In the end it depending on the situation. If we were testing something specific to personalization we often had to create unique experience for each user which then impacted our organization and workflow system since we now had to account for versions like we hadn't done prior.</p>
            <p>If we were testing a something that wasn't directly related to persoanlization then it woudl depend on how much the experience was influenced. We would leverage one of our personas that aligned with most teachers so that content would at least be within their subject and therefore still accurate enough to suspend a bit of disbelief.</p>
