      <p class="projectSubhead">Reimagining and redesigning the Home experience was the final step in the new Discovery
        Education Experience. After we understood what and how we were going to change the rest of the site, we could
        create a homepage that aware and aligned with the there parts of the experience.

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">My Responsibilities & Key Contributions</h2>
        <p>Given the scope and visibility of the homepage experience, I was positioned as the User Experience Architect
          lending a more managerial and leadership based value to this project. Being integrated with so many teams and
          stakeholders allowed myself and Jeff Hopwood (product owner) to align team and organizational expectations.

          -----vs----

          My role in the redesign of the Discovery Education Home experience was User Experience Architect.  As in many projects int he past, the Home experience always attracts a certain type of special attention. Since we built the experience from the inside out, we allowed it to mature and develop while making the Home experience, so we could see what needed to be taken into account. In addition to the fact that the Homepage usually get more attention it was also the last piece to the product suite, and as a result all eyes were on it. It needed a special type of leadership and guidance that resulted in me taking that on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with the back-end, front-end, design, and user community teams, I made sure the experience expectations were managed within the organization, while also directing and monitoring the experience for users.

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">User Research Planning and Integration</h5>
        <p>I was in charge of planning and deligating through the project. After speaking with our U.K. team we teamed
          up and leveraged research they they had done. They had also taken into account student designs more heavily
          which we then turned into production ready designs after some review and refinement. Just as important as as
          doing the research was collecting and digesting it in a usable manner so it could be integrated quickly.

        <p>Partnering with an excellent developer, we made sure all production designs were AA compliant, appropriate
          for screen readers, and made sure we design around touch interfaces. We strive to allow every student the
          ability to have the same experience as the next, regardless of situation. We're legally obligated to be AA
          compliant, but that's a minimum and we believe our work should result in a higher quality of product.

        <p> Working with another researcher we figured out new and creative ways to facilitate remote user research. We
          cycle systems for interviews because we like to continue to leverage different tools and services for their
          different strengths. If we needed a card sort, and the current active services didn't include that we needed
          to plan accordingly and reallocate funds. Working with a budget, even if it was fair, and having restrictions
          forced us to generate creative solutions if we wanted to stick to such an am bitious and active plan.

          Soemthing that can be limiting when testign int he educaitonal tech industry is lack of access to users
          hardware due to secrurity risks and reasons. Collaboration across designers, developers, and certain people
          who just happen to bounce all over the place generating ideas all improved. Having to never sync and monitor a

        <p class="summary">The old home experience had serious usabiliy and engagement issues. By gathering user feedback, analaytics, and the current product suite and company transition, we were able to create a new landing experience for post-login users that increased engagement frequency and scope of products.</p>
        <p>The first job to be done was obtaining any research and any analytics that existed. Using Google Analytics and a newly implemented tool called Pendo we were able organize that while conducting usability and satisfaction research. Gathering usage data and funnels were very useful for the data itself and it also enabled us to identify any potential patterns to be aware of when running research sessions.</p>

        <p>After years of tinkering and in the light of recent software developments, I've developed a very
          cost-effective remote user research solution that we leveraged to get timely, digestable, and actionable data.
          By having assumptions, analytics, and a general awareness of user concerns, it took less than a week to
          facilitate and extract findings that were immeditately integrated into prototypes and planing.Our primary
          techniques user remote moderates usability testing, 1:1 interviews, and almost always surveys as follow-ups to
          studies and as their own studies. This combination of generative and evaluative research was critical in
          discovering and analyzing users' behavior, need, and motivations.</p>

        <p>When evaluating the performance of the old home experience we needed two things: 1) we needed to know what
          would save users time, and 2) we needed a set of goals that could guide the experience and metrics determined
          to result in a successful product. The following were some of our high-level conclusions that were most
          relevant to our goals.

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Irrelevant Feed of Content</h5>
        <p>Social and activity feeds offers details that were too detailed and needed to be consolidated. Users were
          also inundated with certain users and content due to a weak sorting and throttling algorithm.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Not Engaging and Lacked Customization</h5>
        <p>We found that users rarely strayed from certain areas of the site regardless of the content on their
          homepage. At the same time, there wasn't any way for users to personalize their feeds other than district
          settings.
        </p>

      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Low Element Engagement</h5>
        <p>When we changed the hero experience engagement spiked and stuck, but overall, the experience below the hero
          area, while also improved, was still performing at extremely low conversion rates.

      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Users using direct URLs and Bookmarks</h5>
        <p>Analytics showed that often users would use direct bookmarks to certain areas of the site which they found
          most valuabe. This resulted in Home being the least used page of product langins pages and also reduced
          product diversity each user engaged with. .

        <p>We wanted to connect users to the high-quality content they always speak about. Discovery Education is known for good content, and we wanted to increase awareness of not only big changes within DE content, but also changes to content the users is subscribed to or has already used. Keeping the homepage fresh, but also consistent will never stop being a challenge.

      </article>
      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Save students and educators time and effort</h5>
        <p>We invested heavily in the fact that users have many modes and we won't be able to predict which mode they'll arrive in. Making sure that users were aware and had quick access to any path was imperative to us. Bouncing and pogo-sticking back to the home page like users used to do was unacceptable. With the integration of the global navigation, the home experience is with the users throughout. But only what they need, not the content. Just the ability to access the content.

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Be extensible enough to be adapted internationally</h5>
        <p>DE is a global product and we take localization very seriously. We believe that every student and educator should have the same opportunities. With considerations for RTL languages, special character availability in typeface, cultural sensitivities and more everything from content to the interface goes through a litany of checks and use cases to make sure the experience is as uniform and accommodating as possible.

      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading span-col-12">Onboarding and Personalization</h2>
      <p class="span-col-12">Early on in our soft-launch timeline we identified that we were struggling to get users to complete the initial onboarding screen forms. In order for users to have the best experience, and have the most relevant content served to them, we needed to know more about each user. We also wanted to remind users about settings they might have forgotten about and anable them to make any adjustments to make the most out of the transition to a new product.      
      </p> <p class="span-col-12">What started out as a three screen experience ended up being just one page with the plan to replace it all together for a much leaner and less intrusive experience. Initially the intentions were good; allow users the ability the refresh and setup their profiles. Due to a number of reasons we explored with users, the immediate value just wasn't communcated or implemented well enough.

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead span-col-12">Iterative Improvement</h5>
      <p class="span-col-12">The initial prototype called for three on-boarding screens. With less than stellar perforamnce we reduced the experience to two screens and immedately noticed an improvemnt </p>

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead span-col-12">Battling Prior Mental Models</h5>
      <p class="span-col-12">One of the key reason teachers were skipping the screens was because of the unawareness of an experience they were already used to changing. This was different than something new. users already had mental models and assumptions about their profile and the options they selected. They weren't used to them doing much and contiued to assume the same thing.</p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead span-col-12">Minimize Interruption</h5>
      <p class="span-col-12">A critical issue we dealt with was trying to reach teachers and users prior to using the experience. We wanted to establish a voice with users to speak to them and explain exactly why we're asking for their time. The last thing a teacher needs is an additional interruption, nevermind one that result in an entire experience change. The less prepared and exposed a teacher was, the increased lieklyhood that they would skip the onbaording experience.</p>

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Target Demographic</h5>
      <p>Given that the audience Discovery Education serves ranges from students in kindergarten to admins who are
        unfamiliar with modern technology trends. The technical literacy of our users ranges from developmental
        abilities
        at a young age to general lack of experience with computers in old age. We can provide the students and teachers
        with separate experiences, but there still needs to be enough alignment that the teacher can share and align
        with
        students at the same time as having their "enhanced" teacher version. This results in many elements of the
        experiences overlapping.</p>

      <p>It might sound obvious, but it's common to try to implement another company's strategy, process or plan,
        without changing it at all, and then wonder why it didn't work. Utilizing team workshops and break-out sessions,
        we were able to make sure everyone had their voices heard systematically. Leveraging smaller groups with leaders
        that could then communicate, group dynamics were improved and group engagement was improved with attitudes
        becoming more positive after seeing actual progress.
