        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Summary</h2>
        <p>Discovery Education needed a new brand and experience in order to compete within the changing Ed Tech sector. Discovery Education products are split into multiple including Techbook, Platform, and Supplemental. Techbooks include everything having to do with cirriciulum dirven material and the actual Techbooks themselves. Platform as a product is just that - a centeralized digital platform to serve as the site for Discovery Education in which all other products centeralize around. Supplemental as a product is about all of the additional services Discovery Educaiton offers such as classroom managers, quize and assignment builder, and other "supplemental" resources.

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Summary Of Issues</h2>
        The overall product portfolio of Discovery Education was plauged with issues that all contributed to the case for a redesign. Aethetically the experience was dated, inconsistent, and generally tested poorly with users when doing preference and satisfaction research. Functionally, while the site was accessible, it lagged significantly behind competing products, it didn't take advantage of any type of innovative or current technology, was an absolute Information Architecture nightmare, and had been optimized in regards to development, including back-end which resulted in an absurd amount of server requests.

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Home</h5>
        <p>A common theme is that generally all of the products were outdated, but Home was the slight exception to the rule. Seeing as the homepage traditionally has the most visibility, and it was no different at DE, many of the internal exercises and projects that are expected to provide results start on the home page. it was for this reason that it was slightly updated to adhere to the preliminary design specs of the soon to be Comet Design System.
