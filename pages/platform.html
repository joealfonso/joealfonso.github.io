      <p class="projectSubhead">In early 2018 Discovery Education went through some major organizational changes and a
        new experience and brand strategy was started. I was able to lead the user experience team from creation through
        launch.

      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">The Challenge</h2>
      <p>Discovery Education needed a new brand and experience in order to compete within the changing Ed Tech sector.
        Discovery Education products are split into multiple including Techbook, Platform, and Supplemental. Techbooks
        include everything having to do with cirriciulum dirven material and the actual Techbooks themselves.</p>
      <p> Platform as a product is just that - a digital platform to serve as the Discovery Education product suite and
        supplemental content and services. Supplemental as a product is about all of the additional services Discovery
        Education offers such as classroom managers, quiz and assignment builder, and other "supplemental" resources.
        The main product suit consists of Homepage and Global Navigation, Resource Player (where you view resources),
        and Education Networks.
      </p>
      <p>Some of our higher levels usability goals were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase engagement with a larger number of resources per user</li>
          <li>Create a customized and personalized experience that's unique to each user</li>
          <li>Increase the sharing of resources and creations</li>
          <li>Increase awareness of product and services</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We also had to align and support buisiness and stakeholder goals such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase renewals</li>
          <li>Increase engagement with strategies</li>
          <li>Foster a community that provides feedback and has open discussion with each other and the product team</li>

      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading span-col-12">Products in Scope</h2>
      <p class="span-col-12">The overall product portfolio of Discovery Education was plauged with issues that all
        contributed to the case for a redesign. Aethetically the experience was dated, inconsistent, and generally
        tested poorly with users when doing preference and satisfaction research. Functionally, while the site was
        accessible, it lagged significantly behind competing products, it didn't take advantage of any type of
        innovative or current technology, was an absolute Information Architecture nightmare, and had been optimized in
        regards to development, including back-end which resulted in an absurd amount of server requests.
      </p> 
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead span-col-12">Home</h5>
      <p class="span-col-12">Everyone owns the home page an no one owns the home page. The home page always has, and
        always will be the most contentious experience for a product, and it was no different with DE. One of our main
        challenges was creating alignment and shared expectations across a wide enough scope of people taking into
        account enough feedback from stakesholder and users. While slightly more modernized and attractive, functionally
        the current home page was not a sucessful nor engaging experience.

      <p class="span-col-12">It was a poorly implemented social feed just like so many other social feeds made by teams
        that don't specialize in that type of work. Irrelevant content sorted by a poorly done ranking algorithm
        resulted in a soccial feed with minimal engagement from users. Through a series of redesigns, we were able to
        regain and increase usage with the hero, the body of the page remains a struggle. The right side of the page
        offers what was some useful infromation but where the link took you was unpredictable. Even when the homepage
        functioned well, where you went after was often unpredictable in regards to the experience.
      </p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead span-col-12">Player</h5>
      <p class="span-col-12"> This is the page that is designated to hold a single resource. It could be anything from a
        video, to and image, to an interactive to a virtual field trip where you're taken through a virtual tour of an
        event or place.
      </p>
      <p class="span-col-12">One of the main goals of the Player page was to allow users to quickly assess whether a
        piece of content was valuable enouhg to use. The content was most important, but we also had to make sure
        certain features like closed captioning, language options, and curriculum standards were included and easy to
        identify. It was common to hear about teachers not using a resource solely because it couldn't be experienced
        equally by every student in
        the classroom. Inclusive design is a guiding principal of ours and we can identify direct impact of it.
      </p>

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead span-col-12">Networks Channels</h5>
      <p class="span-col-12">Discovery Education provides a wide variety of media and content ranging from first-party
        sources like Myth Busters, to popular publishers, and even user-generated content in addition to all formal and
        cirriculum requred content. This content is also unrestricted and included when distrcits are provisioned
        products providing additional content for students and teachers to learn and use. </p>
      <p class="span-col-12">It was discovered though, over the course of many studies, that a large portion of teachers
        weren't aware of all of the content available and at the same time (not surprisingly) expressed a strong desire
        to have access to additional trusted content. This lead to the inception of the idea of Networks and Channels
        which resulted in completely reworking,repositioning, and consolidating all of that extra material and content
        into a system that made sense, was discoverable and explorable. Channels and networks are experiences setup to
        help students and teachers explore and sort through groups of content. Prior to this, usersmuch of the

      <p>From top to bottom of an organization's structure teams operate differently, have different goals, and speak to
        a different scope of people. It's important to get everyone to align on what is being built and why it's being
        built but in practice that's actually quite a difficult task that can come from many different sources.

      <p>A common theme is that generally all of the products were outdated, but Home was the slight exception to the
        rule. Seeing as the homepage traditionally has the most visibility, and it was no different at DE, many of the
        internal exercises and projects that are expected to provide results start on the home page. It was for this
        reason that Home was slightly updated to adhere to the preliminary design specifications of the soon to be Comet
        Design System.

      <p>You can have the nicest looking most well made solution, but if the content isn't good, no one is going to want to use it. Experiences are there to facilitate something for the user. Fortunately at no point in any
        of our research was content ever an issue. Most of the time in fact, teachers spoke very highly of the
        availability and quality of the content offer by Discovery Education. Having high quality content that users desired made everything we did extra validating. We knew that if we managed to provide a good experience, users It's a huge luxury to be supported by a tested and successful content library. This makes our
        research more valuable, testing is more conclusive, and generally users are excited and enthusiactic to speak
        about it becasue they really value it. THe content helps makes sure we understand we're working towards a good purpose.

      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Leveraging Core Competancies</h2>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">A trusted all-in-one expreince</h5>
      <p>One of the truly unique experiecnes that Discovery Educaiton offers that is rarely seen anywhere else is that
        you can find cited and scholarly materials, save and organize it, edit and create with it, and then share it
        out. It's common to find site that allow collecting, sorting tagging, organziing and sharing, but they don't
        provide content. Or maybe a site provides content, but it's not trusted, or it has advertisements and unfit
        material for the classroom.
      </p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">New content from trusted publishers</h5>
      <p>Having the relationship with Discovery Communications allows teachers to explore an always changing and
        improving library of digital content to supplement their cirriculum and standards based content. Some of the
        most common feedback by education leaders and distrcit representatives has been that the issues isn't with the
        content. That content is consistantly high quality and a leading reason for account retention.
      </p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Classroom management</h5>
      <p>Every year a new roster of students is added and changed for schools and teachers. As regular and as often as
        that experience is. In as many places (everywhere) that it happens, by now you would think there would be some
        sort of universal solution. There isn't. Sometimes it works and soemtimes it doesn't It can vary by school, and
        district and there isn't any real standardization that would validate work on developing integration templates.
        We provided a way for teachers to manage individual students and run large batch actions for manual control of
        rosters that didn't always integrate. Saving time is important to teachers and roster management is seen as an
        unessecary time sink for teachers and this is a feature that comes up often in feedback sessions.
      </p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Single Sign-On and Product integration</h5>
      <p>It's common for a classroom to leverage multiple tools as a part of their product suite. This often requires
        multiple logins for however many students are within a district. This also means additional support and points
        for potential problems. As a huge compliment to the developments teams, DE is known as having one of the better
        experiences in regards to single sign-on systems.

      <p class="span-col-12">The goals and red tasks on a certain page varied from persona to persona a little more
        explicitly than projects I've been involved in the past. Since You could, explore, save, and share content all
        within the same experience, what the users was looking to get done depended on the mode they were in. The goal
        of a user who was on a resource page because they're planning their next lesson is going to have a different goal then the user who is looking for something quickly to share with the class who will have a different goal than the student who had the resource shared with them. Some unique persona splits were age bands, grade bands,
        roles, modes, and saving styles</p>
      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Grade Bands</h5>
        <p>Sections of grades that are generally accepted. Some overlap between districts natually occur. Significant cognitive, and developmental differences occur early resulting in specialized design choices.</p>

      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Age Bands</h5>

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Roles</h5>
        <p> Roles includes, student, teacher, admin, and certain time other specialized positions. Each role comes with a different set of goals and tasks that dictate the experiences differences.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="span-col-6">
        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Modes</h5>
        <p>Modes are what we have identified as the core reason people user the service. The modes we developed are the explorer, the user who is just browsing on their own free will "going down the rabbit hole" and seekiong further knowldge about topics. The planner and collector is someone who has an objective about what they're looking for and want to save and organize material for later. </p>
      </article>
      <article class="span-col-6">
          <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Saving Style</h5>
          <p>Users usually collecting and saved in one of two different ways. The planner would organize as they saved resources makig sure to tag and label as they wents resulting in a lower quantioty, but higher ration of usage. The collector would save a high volume of content, but would go back at a later time and sift through to organize or use it all. One style is front loaded while the other is heavy in effort later on in the process.</p>
