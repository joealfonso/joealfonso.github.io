        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Summary</h2>
        <p>Discovery Education needed a new brand and experience in order to compete within the changing Ed Tech sector. Discovery Education products are split into multiple including Techbook, Platform, and Supplemental. Techbooks include everything having to do with cirriciulum dirven material and the actual Techbooks themselves. Platform as a product is just that - a centeralized digital platform to serve as the site for Discovery Education in which all other products centeralize around. Supplemental as a product is about all of the additional services Discovery Educaiton offers such as classroom managers, quize and assignment builder, and other "supplemental" resources.

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Summary Of Issues</h2>
        <p>The overall product portfolio of Discovery Education was plauged with issues that all contributed to the case for a redesign. Aethetically the experience was dated, inconsistent, and generally tested poorly with users when doing preference and satisfaction research. Functionally, while the site was accessible, it lagged significantly behind competing products, it didn't take advantage of any type of innovative or current technology, was an absolute Information Architecture nightmare, and had been optimized in regards to development, including back-end which resulted in an absurd amount of server requests.

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Home</h5>
        <p>Everyone owns the home page an no one owns the home page. The home page always has, and always will be the most contentious experience for a product, and it was no different with DE. One of our main challenges was creating alignment and shared expectations across a wide enough scope of people taking into account enough feedback from stakesholder and users. While slightly more modernized and attractive, functionally the current home page was not a sucessful nor engaging experience. 
          </p>
          <p>It was a poorly implemented social feed just like so many other social feeds made by teams that don't specialize in that type of work. Irrelevant content sorted by a poorly done ranking algorithm resulted in a soccial feed with minimal engagement from users. Through a series of redesigns, we were able to regain and increase usage with the hero, the body of the page remains a struggle. The right side of the page offers what was some useful infromation but where the link took you was unpredictable. Even when the homepage functioned well, where you went after was often unpredictable in regards to the experience. 
            </p>

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Player</h5>
        <p> This is the page that is designated to hold a single resource. It could be anything from a video, to and image, to an interactive to a virtual field trip where you're taken through a virtual tour of an event or place. 
        </p>

        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Networks Channels</h5>
        <p>Discovery Education provides a wide variety of media and content ranging from first-party sources like Myth Busters, to popular publishers, and even user-generated content in addition to all formal and cirriculum requred content. This content is also unrestricted and included when distrcits are provisioned products providing additional content for students and teachers to learn and use. </p>
          <p>It was discovered though, over the course of many studies, that a large portion of teachers weren't aware of all of the content available and at the same time (not surprisingly) expressed a strong desire to have access to additional trusted content. This lead to the inception of the idea of Networks and Channels which resulted in completely reworking,repositioning, and consolidating all of that extra material and content into a system that made sense, was discoverable and explorable. Channels and networks are experiences setup to help students and teachers explore and sort through groups of content. Prior to this, usersmuch of the supplementtal material Discovery Education offered

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Home is where the... products are</h2>
        <p>A common theme is that generally all of the products were outdated, but Home was the slight exception to the rule. Seeing as the homepage traditionally has the most visibility, and it was no different at DE, many of the internal exercises and projects that are expected to provide results start on the home page. It was for this reason that Home was slightly updated to adhere to the preliminary design specifications of the soon to be Comet Design System.

        <p>When we design, we try to deliver (hopefully) high quality content in an effective manner. At no point in any of our research was content ever a glaring issue. Most of the time in fact, teachers spoke very highly of the availability and quality of the content offer by Discovery Education. A huge part of the experience was taken care of for us. It's a huge luxury to be supported by a tested and successful content library. This makes our research more valuable, testing is more conclusive, and generally users are excited and enthusiactic to speak about it becasue they really value it.
