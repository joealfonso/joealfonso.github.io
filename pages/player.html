     <p class="projectSubhead">After receiving enough feedback we decided it was time to rework the Resource Player
       page experience into an experience that supported quick assessment, supporting materials, and ways to engage
       with the classroom using the resource.

       <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">What is Player?</h2>
       <p>Player is short for "Resource Player" which is how students and teachers view each individual resource within
         Discovery Education. We retained the term "player" due to the fact that there were many long-term users who
         still understood Discovery Education through a certain lens. For this reason we reworked it and leveraged it
         to resonate with older, newer, and soon-to-be users.</p>
       <p>We approached the new Player experience based on three core goals that we discovered students and teachers
         try to accomplish most often when encountering a resource. Our new solution needed to allow quick assessment
         and comprehension, offer relevant related content based on the user and the resource, and lastly, to
         facilitate and demonstrate how to use the resources within the classroom. </p>
       <p>The last goal "demonstrate how to use the resource within the classroom" was one of our most unique findings.
         It's often assumed that teachers always have well put together, perfectly planned lesson plans for every piece
         of content and type of learning method they use. This is just not what happens in many classrooms. For any
         numbers of reasons ranging from unpredicted changes for the teacher, or even if a teacher just wants to try
         something new with a new resource;reducing the amount of thinking and decision making a teacher has to do is
         one of the most important goals that guides our entire organization down to every last designer and developer.
         <strong>Teachers matter and it's our goal to support them.</strong></p>

       <p class="summary">We identified an opportunity to try implementing design sprints in order to optimize the resource Player experience. I worked closely with 2 developers to quickly assess, design, test, and iterate within a very tight timeline.
       </p>
       <p>We had identified through some prior research that the Player page could benefit from information architecture and design changes. I took the opportunity to try out a small design sprint. It's one of those things you read about but always find challenging to get others involved. Since it was a small team, the ask wasn't significant, in addition to the fact that they were super collaborative to begin with.</p>
       <p>
         Managing progress was a balance that required enough trust to allow an informal process to be productive. By
         explicitly separating rolls, but always encouraging feedback and critiques, we managed to quickly iterate and make small, meaningful, and impactful changes that resulted in a new and optimized Player experience.

       <h2 class="projectSectionHeading ">What to Change and Why?</h2>
       <p class="summary">With the focus on using familiar patterns and allowing content to shine, by reducing low value information and rearranging the hierarchy of the page, we managed to create a much more effective experience.</p>
       <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Like? You know... Whatever.</h5>
       <!––https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax25gfr5J98––>
       <p>Over the course of a number of studies one of the most consistent findings we found was ambiguity on the expected behavior and the actual behavior of the "likes" dynamic on educational resources.
       </p>
       <p>There was an interesting dynamic in the fact that people seem to use likes, hearts, claps, etc. and it generally comes down to internal versus external motivations. A person would "like/heart" something as an expression or reaction or they would do it with the expectation of saving, marking, or somehow designating an item for some reason at a later time. The results varied by age, service, icon, and context. Results varied but generally the heart icon always resulted as the most controversial.</p>
       <p>The dynamic of "likes" also affected other areas of the experience such as saving content for the user, weighting resources when searching, and the entirely new customization and personalization system we were also in the process of producing. Given the findings of the research and the fact that we only wanted to introduce an element when it worked, instead of changing it mid-experience, we elected to dedicate a more significant amount of time to the entire dynamic of that type of user input.</p>
       <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Focus the User and Highlight the Content</h5>
       <p>Something that we noticed during research sessions was the tendency for teachers to often reference additional material before completely understanding the main resource first. When going back and watching mouse tracking information, we noticed that there movement and highlighting of areas that weren't part of the task nor the thoughts they were speaking to. We interpreted this as a subconscious action as a result of poor information hierarchy.

       <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Incorporate New Patterns</h5>
       <p>Discovery Education encourages discovery and exploration of resources and materials. This is supported by the dynamic of customized feeds of information and resources. Facilitated and found mainly within the Channels experience, we started to utilize the same patterns within the Player page to keep a new but familiar feel and to improve the design inconsistencies of the previous iteration.

       <h2 class="projectSectionHeading ">Experimenting With Process</h2>
       <p class="summary">Taking a chance with a new but small team, we consolidated workflows into design sprints that integrated and supported our current processes.</p>
 
       <p>Sometimes in Figma, sometimes in html, and other times on phone calls, the work that needed to be done, was done in the best way possible. With team alignment on general expectations and goals, we were able to take advantage of this freedom to sidestep the usual Jira ticket system and abbreviate it combined with what we roughly called design sprints. We were working off of what design sprints meant as in having quick iterative, but explicit stages of progress.</p>
       <p>When you really get to experience true fluidity in workflow between, research, design, and development, it can result in an extremely fulfilling experience that everyone is proud to have invested themselves into. And when that happens, presenting on meetings is more engaging and the increased energy is tangible. </p>

       <h2 class="projectSectionHeading ">Player Reworked</h2>
       <p class="summary">Having felt we met all of the requirements for a successful experience the team agreed with the solution and we staged the launch and support campaign.</p>
       <p>By really taking the time to explore exactly why we wanted to change Player, how we wanted to, and what we needed to build towards, we established an alignment in expectations that help support decisions. We carefully tested some wilder solution that took some of the goals explicitly by trying to promote good material more actively. This resulted in a hard to balance line of promoting content and not being perceived as an ad. It had to be almost too perfect to work within a pedagogical setting and still be useful and tasteful.</p>
 
 
 
 
       <p>What we decided on allowed the content and information about the content to take center stage and allow the user to engage with the resource fully before facilitating alternatives or supporting material that is customized and relevant to the user. </p>
 
       <p>After a few weeks of hard work, constant communication, and considerate collaboration we presented to stakeholders and the internal teams. It tested to our standards and it was sent to QA to be staged for release. </p>

       <h2 class="projectSectionHeading ">Retrospective</h2>
       <p class="summary">The new experience set out to provide a solution that set out to accomodate all users by
         leveraging a personalization system, new layout based around teaching and learning modes, and a persistent
         navigation system that acted as a "mini" version of the homepage.</p>
       <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Matching Aspect Ratios and Vertical media Queries</h5>
 
       <p>In education technology Chromebooks are very popular. Many Chromebooks are also hybrid devices that have to account for touch inputs. For this reason the Chrome toolbars are made to be a certain minimum size. This results in the user having around ~576px vertically on a traditional 1029x1280 device and videos with 16:9 aspect ratios to be overwhelming in height. When this happens, often the "fullscreen" option is actually smaller, but made to fit the screen more appropriately since the controls account for native user interface. </p>
