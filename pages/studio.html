      <h3 class="projectSubhead">Creating a modern, sandbox type tool for tomorrow’s classrooms</h3>
      <p class="typl8-drop-cap">I helped create, design, plan, and launch an ambitious new product within EdTech. Discovery Education Studio
        has set a new standard for classroom collaboration and productivity as a result of years of research and hard
        work. Through the power of Studio, teachers and students and teachers can interact, collaborate, and build like
        never before, all in real time. </p>

      <p>DE Studio introduces a touch-friendly interface in which users can place, edit, and organize content in any
        form they choose. Using a free-form grid with anchor points, this allows the user to create an attractive and
        comprehensible space. After the user is done creating, they can share and distribute in a number of ways
        controlled by a permissions and intent system. For example, questions posed on distributed content can have
        different behaviors, in relation to whether it’s a quiz, homework assignment, class poll, or a number of other
        specific, but widely used scenarios.

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>Studio started as a three person team that would grow and shrink multiple times throughout its development,
        with long periods of just two of us — the other member being the project founder, creator, and lead developer.
        My roles spanned the scope of research, design, prototype development, and marketing. I took the opportunity to
        champion certain operations and philosophies like inclusive and universal design, as more closely integrated
        marketing strategy, in-product messaging, as well as integrated product and user support. .

        <div>
          <h4>Cross-Platform Team and Product Integration</h4>
          <p>As this would be the main end-point for content collection and creation, we had to talk and plan across
            multiple teams addressing technical and front-end issues at the same time. Making sure to speak to the
            appropriate teams about concerns and collaboration was an intangible, but critical task of managing
            expectations and supporting decisions. --- Delegate and work properly across teams, asking questions during
            discovery phase, reported back, double checking to report their needs and circle back to find the best
            solutions and outcome.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>Teaching is incredibly challenging, no one will ever deny that because it’s absolutely true. Through years of
        research we learned about how teachers explore, collect and share content. At the core of every classroom are
        those three functions. Now we all have our own systems for saving content that fits the way we want it to. And
        if we don’t we can go choose another tool and try again. This isn’t possible in the classroom, at least not
        easily.

        Most of the time teachers have multiple logins that they need to manage. That’s fine as it’s usually handle by a
        service call Single Sign-On (SSO) that will consolidate many accounts under one login. The problem is that it
        isn’t reliable on most systems, and it might have a limited scope leaving certain products to the user. Another
        issue is with tool selection. Many times teachers won’t get to choose their tools due to district regulations.
        If they do, they lose support and generally have to operate on their own, and with a risk of security and
        information. I could go on, but those are a few of the challenges that are often overlooked or not seen.

      <h2>So Many Solutions, but Nothing Complete</h2>
      <p>Schools have disconnected suites of tools that support struggles to handle and students and teachers create
        their own solutions for. Due to Single Sign-On (SSO) issues, unaligned accounts, personal accounts and so
        fourth, it’s extremely difficult to align solutions for districts.

        As a result, teachers have generally started to devise their own ways of saving and distributing by balancing
        new tools such as Google, that are easy to save most types of content, and re-purposing tools such as Discovery
        Education to work in a way that’s better for them, even if it’s not how it was ever intended to be used.

      <h2>Research as the Guiding Light</h2>
      <p>As mentioned in prior sections, user research was an on-going operation that generally never stopped. We had
        campaigns of three different scales and we operated based on the effort total and timeline.

        Building around our main personas of Hunter, Gatherer, and Explorer and then later breaking them down even more,
        we generally found all of our goals and most user needs represented. Our personas were used to advocate
        internally for the user, and to demonstrate to other teams the important and identify of the users we design
        for.

        Our whole strategy and project brief was established around the culmination of 4 years of research which
        established that there are three core needs in every classroom:


        > Collecting content
        > Editing the content
        > Sharing the content

        At the time we were working on the project, Google Classrooms had just integrated functionality beyond storage
        and organization of content. Prior to this, Google had made a major push into the education market with Google
        Classroom solely by serving as a tool to collect, distribute, and manage content found around the web.

        It’s difficult to find a product that accommodates all three tasks, it’s even harder to find one that supplies
        reputable and scholarly materials, and even hard than that to find within education tech. There are very few
        services where someone can explore and find quality educational content, save and store it content, generate
        their own content, and then share and collaborate on it within the classroom.

        A unique challenge that Studio presented was the fact that it was a free-form sandbox type editing tool where
        users could drag and drop elements, resize them and rearrange them at will, all responsibly while accommodating
        for lower-end touch screen devices and connections. Given these conditions in addition to regular accessibility
        standards, creating elegant solutions that were also usable across devices and grade bands was the absolute most
        challenging project i had ever dealt with at the time.

      <h2>A Pedigogical Distribution Model for the Modern Classroom</h2>
      <p>Teachers and students have come up with their own custom ways of finding, saving, editing, and distributing
        content to compensate for the lack of a cohesive tool that can satisfy these core needs. While everyone does it
        their own way, it all boils down to finding a tool that is capable of saving and storing content. Then it they
        need to use the tool to share it. The tool now needs to speak to something else, many times an obscure internal
        tool. If it does allow for direct sharing, what type of sharing does it allow for? Can you send to multiple
        students at once? How customizable is the recipients list? Does the recipient have to do anything? Do they need
        an account? Does the district allow it?

      <h2>Performance and Satisfaction</h2>
      <p>Since Studio had to integrate with every product actively, our success metrics were composed of a taxonomy
        structure. Each goals had a value and each product had a value as well that attributed to the goals worth.

        At the top of the structure was performance, satisfaction, and business goals. Performance was one of the more
        challenging goals to align with due to the fact that much of what we were doing wasn’t done on the web prior,
        and we had to have checkpoints at different points of scale.

        Products that were retired as a result of Studio, often became indicators of key functionality. Tracking and
        data were retained and adjusted as needed for the new environment.

        While I helped with technical and performance monitoring when relevant, my actual responsibility was
        establishing, obtaining, and monitoring satisfaction and usability performance. By continually running research
        studies both internally and externally, we were able to keep a handle what were the key issues currently, and
        what might become something significant. Paired with quick iterative design, we were able to pivot and change
        quickly during the early development stages. Never getting too far off of what the business and users wanted.

      <h2>Performance and Satisfaction</h2>
      <p>SaaS launches are a little different in the education market. We were limited by a few factors. Two critical
        challenges were district contracts and the other being general user behavior dictates that most of the time
        teachers are tasked based in their use cases. They don’t have time to stop and learn a new product most days.
        And if they do, it’s mostly on their own time outside of specific training sessions.

      <h2>Supporting Success</h2>
      <p>A products success is not fully defined by successful usability and being able to complete tasks. It’s a
        popular belief that products shouldn’t require any instruction and that it should just work, but that’s just not
        possible on certain products, especially when it’s a non-traditional experience. —you need good ui, functional
        and attractive interface, user engagement, marking

        Working with the marketing, copy-writing, content, and email distribution teams, we created a campaign that
        supported the initial discovery phase of research, managing to create a healthy user-base that created ownership
        very early on. Working across media channels such as Discovery Educators Network (DEN), discussing and
        presenting in person at conferences.

      <h2>The Future of the Product and Scalability</h2>
      <p>With scalability built into the fundamental framework of Studio, the future is bright. With over 10,000
        concurrent users at maximum load, Studio has held up relatively well. We still have issue with things such as
        icons loading in poorly and not showing up, but overall, they’re down to quality of life issues. We’re looking
        to the future with the component type elements Studio is based around. We have ideas and explorations with VR,
        AR, drawing

          <h4>Tangible Real-Time Collaboration</h4>
          <p>Not only do we allow users to work together, but you can actually see who is doing what as their cursor moves on your screen. We wanted to create a living space that users shared and worked on together. It’s one thing to pass a document back and fourth, it’s another to update it live, and it’s even ANOTHER thing when you can actually see what someone else is doing as if they were in the same physical space. 

              I used tools like After Effects and principle to design much of the collaborative experience. Due to the nature of our collaboration being real-time and simultaneous, much of the intent and behavior required motion and interactions to be created and conducted in order to test, and get a sense of how these advanced features might feel, prior to investing heavily into any one method.

          <p>Leveraging new web technologies, we’re able to provide an extremely optimized and equal experience to each user. If our products and features fail our low-end device tests, then the whole task fails and we then set in to optimize and decide. Everyone student deserves the same opportunity to learn

        <div>
          <h4>Tracking and History</h4>
          <p>Each Studio board has its own history, and everyone in that board has their own participation history. This is big for a few reasons. First, it helps teachers track participation and facilitates pro-active participation. Secondly, having a history allows version control so nothing is lost. In addition, with a playback feature, we allow the users to see, over time, how the project has evolved and grown. Thirdly, and arguably most important, is the fact that since the teachers can see how students build, behave and edit, we look forward to being able to identify cognitive issues in new ways.n.
