        <p>DE Studio introduces a totally inclusive and accessible digital resource creation tool, in which users can create, edit, and organize content in order to collaborate, present, assess, and more. In what we call a "sandbox" type experience, we remove many of the traditional mental models of web and technology in order to allow and guide exploration and creation. 
          We allow teachers and students to create digital content and designs called "Boards" by using resources from Discovery Education or their own content and media. What gets created is all up to the user. Examples are presentations, strategies, quizzes, polls, and planners. By allowing additional fucntionality beyond just classroom material and including live collaboration, we managed to significantly increased enagement with resources and even more so with the amount of sharing being done.

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">My Role</h2>
        <p>I was the Product Designer for an innovative new sandbox creation tool for Discovery Education. I also championed inclusive design principles and accessible design while working closely with the development team. As a result, a set of growing standards were developed and integrated into the master portfolio of Discovery Education.

        <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
        <h4 class="projectSectionSubheading">Strategy and Alignment</h4>
        <p>If you ask anyone on a team a question, everyone should answer that question in the same way generally. Making sure everyone understood and aligned towards a common goal really does make a significant difference in over the course of a project.
        </p>

        <h4>Inclusive and Universal Design</h4>
        <p>Poor hardware, slow connections, increased security, and limited acces to technology a few of the challenges student and teachers face. We established a common baseline of performance that the experience had to meet or surpass. This is where Strategy and Alignment really support the process.

          <h4>Look and Feel</h4>
          <p>I instituted the visual direction and design including interactions, state design, and design system integration. Keeping in mind touch users, creating a functional interface that was also attractive and engaging was a unique challenge and resulted in the inability to rely on hover for any primary state changes.

        <h2>The Challenge and Goal</h2>
        <p> We set out with the goal to leverage innovative web technology in order to create a tool that allowed students and teachers to find, collect, create, and share all in the same place. In addition, real-time collaboration, group chat, and a full history of activity allows teachers a level of control and insight into project participation.

        <h2>The Teacher Collection and Distribution Model</h2>
        <p>Schools have disconnected suites of tools that support struggles to handle and students and teachers create
          their own solutions for. Due to Single Sign-On (SSO) issues, unaligned accounts, personal accounts and so
          fourth, it’s extremely difficult to align solutions for districts.

          As a result, teachers have generally started to devise their own ways of saving and distributing by balancing
          new tools such as Google, that are easy to save most types of content, and re-purposing tools such as
          Discovery
          Education to work in a way that’s better for them, even if it’s not how it was ever intended to be used.

        <h2>Research: Early, Often, Fast</h2>
        <p> Due do various conditions and an ever-changing, fast paced environment, we made sure to take the time to develop and plan a research strategy that scaled depending on what the goals and methods were. Working on a system of different levels of research scope ranging from small internal feedback, to long-term studies, all research had to be take into account during project planning for the facilitation and also the integration of feedback. 
        
          It was during this time that I noticed a critical flaw in so many project plans is that they don't take into account the results of research. Many companies and teams like the CONCEPT of user research, but don't actually like the facilitation, synthesization, and integration of research.

        
          A unique challenge that Studio presented when doing research was the fact that it was a free-form sandbox type editing tool where
          users could drag and drop elements, resize them and rearrange them at will, all while
          accommodating
          for lower-end touch screen devices and connections. Given these conditions in addition to regular
          accessibility
          standards, creating elegant solutions that were also usable across devices and grade bands was the absolute
          most
          challenging and fulfilling projects I had ever encountered.

        <h2>A Sharing Model for the Modern Classroom</h2>
        <p>Teachers and students have come up with their own custom ways of finding, saving, editing, and distributing
          content to compensate for the lack of a cohesive tool that can satisfy these core needs. While everyone does
          it
          their own way, it all boils down to finding a tool that is capable of collecting, editing, and sharing content. Then it they
          need to use the tool to share it. The tool now needs to speak to something else, many times an obscure
          internal
          tool. If it does allow for direct sharing, what type of sharing does it allow for? Can you send to multiple
          students at once? How customizable is the recipients list? Does the recipient have to do anything? Do they
          need
          an account? Does the district allow it?

        <h2>So Many Solutions, but Nothing Complete</h2>
        <p>Schools have disconnected suites of tools that support struggles to handle and students and teachers create
          their own solutions for. Due to Single Sign-On (SSO) issues, unaligned accounts, personal accounts and so
          fourth, it’s extremely difficult to align solutions for districts.

        <h2>Performance and Satisfaction</h2>
        <p>Since Studio had to integrate with every product actively, our success metrics were composed of a taxonomy
          structure. Each goals had a value and each product had a value as well that attributed to the goals worth.

          At the top of the structure was performance, satisfaction, and business goals. Performance was one of the more
          challenging goals to align with due to the fact that much of what we were doing wasn’t done on the web prior,
          and we had to have checkpoints at different points of scale.

          Products that were retired as a result of Studio, often became indicators of key functionality. Tracking and
          data were retained and adjusted as needed for the new environment.

          While I helped with technical and performance monitoring when relevant, my actual responsibility was
          establishing, obtaining, and monitoring satisfaction and usability performance. By continually running
          research
          studies both internally and externally, we were able to keep a handle what were the key issues currently, and
          what might become something significant. Paired with quick iterative design, we were able to pivot and change
          quickly during the early development stages. Never getting too far off of what the business and users wanted.

        <h2>Supporting Success</h2>
        <p>SaaS launches are a little different in the education market. We were limited by a few factors. Two critical
          challenges were district contracts and the other being general user behavior dictates that most of the time
          teachers are tasked based in their use cases. They don’t have time to stop and learn a new product most days.
          And if they do, it’s mostly on their own time outside of specific training sessions.
        </p>
        <p>A products success is not fully defined by successful usability and being able to complete tasks. It’s a
          popular belief that products shouldn’t require any instruction and that it should just work, but that’s just
          not
          possible on certain products, especially when it’s a non-traditional experience. —you need good ui, functional
          and attractive interface, user engagement, marking

          Working with the marketing, copy-writing, content, and email distribution teams, we created a campaign that
          supported the initial discovery phase of research, managing to create a healthy user-base that created
          ownership
          very early on. Working across media channels such as Discovery Educators Network (DEN), discussing and
          presenting in person at conferences.

        <h2>The Future of the Product and Scalability</h2>
        <p>With scalability built into the fundamental framework of Studio, the future is bright. With over 10,000
          concurrent users at maximum load, Studio has held up relatively well. We still have issue with things such as
          icons loading in poorly and not showing up, but overall, they’re down to quality of life issues. We’re looking
          to the future with the component type elements Studio is based around. We have ideas and explorations with VR,
          AR, drawing

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">What Makes Studio So Special?</h2>
        <h4>Tangible Real-Time Collaboration</h4>
        <p>Not only do we allow users to work together, but you can actually see who is doing what as their cursor
          moves on your screen. We wanted to create a living space that users shared and worked on together. It’s one
          thing to pass a document back and fourth, it’s another to update it live, and it’s even ANOTHER thing when
          you can actually see what someone else is doing as if they were in the same physical space.

          I used tools like After Effects and principle to design much of the collaborative experience. Due to the
          nature of our collaboration being real-time and simultaneous, much of the intent and behavior required
          motion and interactions to be created and conducted in order to test, and get a sense of how these advanced
          features might feel, prior to investing heavily into any one method.


          <h4>Optimization and Modern Technology</h4>
          <p>Leveraging new web technologies, we’re able to provide an extremely optimized and equal experience to each
            user. If our products and features fail our low-end device tests, then the whole task fails and we then set
            in to optimize and decide. Everyone student deserves the same opportunity to learn

            <h4>Tracking and History</h4>
            <p>Each Studio board has its own history, and everyone in that board has their own participation history.
              This
              is big for a few reasons. First, it helps teachers track participation and facilitates pro-active
              participation. Secondly, having a history allows version control so nothing is lost. In addition, with a
              playback feature, we allow the users to see, over time, how the project has evolved and grown. Thirdly,
              and
              arguably most important, is the fact that since the teachers can see how students build, behave and edit,
              we
              look forward to being able to identify cognitive issues in new ways.n.
