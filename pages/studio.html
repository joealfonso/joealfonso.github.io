      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Summary</h2>
      <p>Discovery Education’s design tool, Board Builder, was built on outdated technology, sub-standard sharing
        models, and was no longer serving the needs of modern education systems with the evolution of classrooms and
        technology.
      </p>
      <p>We developed a product that leverages modern web-technologies and that enables one of the most engaging,
        collaborative, and innovative experiences in education technology. Driven by years of collected research, we
        discovered that teachers generally use the same discovery, collection, and sharing models with their students
        and colleagues. Using this as a model, we created a solution that creates a centralized experience for students
        and teachers to engage with resources and each other at a greater level.

      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As the product and lead user-experience designer for Studio, I advocated for both the user and Discovery
        Education, from planning and delegating, to delivering production-ready solutions. In addition, I helped aid the
        team in solving daily to large scale problems, creating a product of high-quality, user-friendly design that
        aids students and teachers.
      </p>

      <p>
        A large part of Studio’s success hinged on creating a safe, diverse, and conducive environment that allowed for
        innovative ideas to be expressed. Working with the development team, we created a live and easy to access
        development environment that any member of the product team could access and start exploring.

      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Introducing Discovery Education Studio</h2>
      <p>Teachers and students primarily mostly improvised their own methods of finding, saving, editing, and
        distributing content, without the use of a cohesive tool to satisfy these core tasks. With Studio, we created a
        “sandbox” type experience, that removes the traditional limitations of a website, where we removed the
        traditional mental models of web and technology, resulting in a unique and creative experience.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/studio/BoardsMock1.png" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes"
        class="projectImage " />

      <p>
        Studio enables teachers and students to create digital creations and designs called "Boards" by using resources
        from Discovery Education and their own content and media. What is created is all at the user’s imagination. Some
        examples include presentations, strategies, quizzes, polls, and planners. With allowing access beyond just
        classroom material, with included live collaboration, we have significantly increased engagement with resources
        and sharing.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>


  <section class="sectionWrapper wrapperGrey" id="whatDoesItDo">
    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">What does studio do exactly?</h2>
      <p>Well… an awful lot! The experience Studio offers has been described in many ways, as a design tool, creation
        tool, lesson planning tool, just to name a few. It’s our “sandbox” experience that allows the user to craft
        their own creation, and to use as a tool to solve problems they're likely to encounter within the classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Describing an open experience can be complicated since you don’t want necessarily dictate how the user uses it.
        If the user wants to make a class announcement, they can use Studio. Creating a poster for a school event?
        Studio. The lesson plan for the next chapter in biology? Studio. Social media images and content? Studio. Memes?
        Oh you bet you can do that in Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers and students have taken their personal content and Discovery’s content together to use Studio in ways
        that never stop amazing us. Some examples include students printing out and displaying their creations, to
        teachers and students using it for their personal work.

      </p>
    </div>

  <section class="sectionWrapper " id="newModel">
    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">A new model for classrooms</h2>
      <p>One of the significant motivating factors when exploring the initial ideas of Discovery Education's Studio
        was in understanding how teachers organize, edit, and share content. Through research led by Geoffrey
        Robertson, we discovered that, most teachers would save the desired
        content in a variety of ways ranging from self emails with a filter system, to sorted offline thumb drives, to
        any number of external services.

      </p>

      <p class="projectCaption">Behavior Model of Digital Resource Management</p>
      <p class="imageAbove">
        <p>Teachers are extremely hard-working, resourceful, and determined. Many times with little to no complaints
          we've seen teachers use products in completely unintentional and unique ways in order to get them to
          facilitate
          their goals. Understanding why and how led us to truly focus on the sharing, invitation, and distribution
          of content.</p>
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>


  <section class="sectionWrapper wrapperGrey" id="researchPlanExplore">
    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Research, Plan, Explore, and Align</h2>
      <p>Leveraging previous research, we were able to identify the user’s frustrations, desires, and behaviors. From
        there, we established a taxonomy of goals and benefits that were necessary to ensure a successful product. These
        goals served as guiding principles for the project living in creative briefs, research, and user personas.
      </p>
      <p>Being able to unify the organization to agree on the vision, benefits, and core competencies of Studio served
        as an essential part of making intelligent and valuable use of time on meetings, reviews and planning. By
        aligning and sharing the same expectations we were able to make decisions faster, more gravefully, and make
        differences in opinions and assumptions generally a net positive.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/studio/Team.jpg" aria-label="Myself and Jeff Hopwood talking" class="projectImage" />
      <p class="projectCaption"> That's me on the left.</p>

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Leveraging personas </h5>
      <p>Given that so much can be done with Studio as a result of the open design experience, the number of variables
        per task, goal, and means to get to those goals were large in number. I addressed this by establishing
        personas that had specific and significant touch-points with tangible goals.
        <img src="../images/studio/PersonaTemplate.png" aria-label="Behavior Model of Digital Resource Management"

  <section class="sectionWrapper " id="establishingGoals">
    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Establishing and measuring goals</h2>
      <p>Using traditional metrics such as time on task, success rate, critical and minor errors, in addition to a few
        contextual metrics, we were able to establish a usability standard for user performance and satisfaction.
        Engagement with certain functionality was traced to make sure users were aware and able to take full
        advantage of the experience. Certain flows of Board Builder, the Product Studio was replacing, such as sharing,
        adding elements, creating pages and so fourth were tracked and measured as well.
      </p>
      <p>Measuring against Board Builder allowed us to test significantly more than just product performance. It also
        created the opportunity to measure engagement with the rest of the site. Studio is where all of the
        exploring, reading, and collecting of resources teachers and students are required to do, end up. There's not
        much to do with a webpage within a classroom unless supplementing with a tool, and Studio enables the additional
        engagement.

  <section class="sectionWrapper wrapperGrey" id="earlyExploration">
    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Early exploration</h2>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Understanding the problem and solution</h5>
      <p>From the start we had an idea for the type of functionality users wanted. It's common to be a little
        off target at first and we were. While I was developing the initial prototypes, I went to the extreme and
        emulated what was a full editing tool. Most users will tell you they want as much customization as possible.
        The CONCEPT seems great, but in the end, users need a customization system that's out of the way when it's not
        needed while also being available and contextual when it is needed.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/studio/team/TheChallenge.jpg" aria-label="Myself and Jeff Hpwood talking"
        class="projectImage " />

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Iteration early and often</h5>
      <p>Initially our prototypes were way too detailed and offered too much control all at once. It worked for the
        enthusiast or professional, but not for students and teachers.
      </p>

      <img src="../images/studio/Studio-EarlyPrototypes.png" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes"

      <img src="../images/studio/InitialDashboard.jpg" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes"
        class="projectImage " />
      <p class="projectCaption">Early Studio Dashboard designs</p>
      <p>Ultimately students and teachers want something easy to use. Teachers want to deliver content and students
        want to submit and share. Everyone also wants to create. In order to make Studio genuinely engaging to all
        users it had to look good and feel good. We addressed the looking good part by introducing a complex system of
        themes that were fully accessible and systematically diverse.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>


  <section class="sectionWrapper " id="stayingFocused">
    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Staying focused on Key features</h2>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Accessible themes</h5>
      <p>Not everyone checks for accessibility when they create things and that's okay. We also understand that color
        accessibility is extremely important in classrooms in order to provide equivalent experience and opportunities
        to all students. I personally went through and crafted a number of themes that retained accessible text and
        offered customizable and accessible backgrounds.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/studio/3colorThemes.png" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes"
        class="projectImage " />

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Guided customization</h5>
      <p>Users will almost always say they want more customization options when asked. With every
        added element of customization you also increase the complexity of the system. What we started out with in the
        image above was overwhelming for most users.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/studio/GuidedCustomization.png" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes"
        class="projectImage " />

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Tangible Real-Time Collaboration</h5>
      <p>Not only do we allow users to work together, they can actually see who is doing what as their cursor
        moves on their screens. We wanted to create a living space that users shared and worked on together. It’s one
        thing to pass a document back and forth, it’s another to update it live, and it’s even ANOTHER thing when
        you can actually see what someone else is doing as if they were in the same physical space.</p>

      <p> I've used tools such as After Effects and principle to design much of the collaborative experience. Due to the
        nature of our collaboration being real-time and simultaneous, much of the intent and behavior required
        motion and interactions to be created and conducted in order to test, and get a sense of how these advanced
        features might feel, prior to investing heavily into any one method.</p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Optimization and Modern Technology</h5>
      <p>Leveraging new web technologies, we’re able to provide an extremely optimized and equal experience to each
        user. We’ve tested and ensured that our products and features will work on all types and levels of devices.Every
        student deserves the same opportunity to learn.</p>

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Tracking and History</h5>
      <p>Each Studio board has its own history, and everyone on that board has their personal participation history.
        This
        is big for a few reasons. Foremost, it helps teachers track participation and facilitates proactive
        participation. Secondly, having a history allows version control so nothing is lost. In addition, with a
        playback feature, we allow the users to see, over time, how the project has evolved and grown. Thirdly,
        and
        arguably most aspect,the the teachers are able to see how students create, behave, and edit, allowing them to
        identify cognitive strengths and issues in new ways.

      <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">The Final Product</h2>
      <p>The culmination of over four years of research and two years of hard work, Studio was ready for a launch
        strategy.</p>

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Launch plan</h5>
      <p>Working with stakeholders, management, and the marketing team we established a progressive launch plan that
        spanned about 14 months. This allowed the team, product, and community to grow together resulting in a
        really strong and transparent relationship. </p>
      <p>We had to align the launch with the school year calendar and limitations. . With a soft launch before summer we
        were able to achieve a significant amount of production level testing without critical consequences. This also
        allowed us to
        increase marketing and awareness campaigns. </p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Optimization and feature timeline</h5>
      <p>Once launched we then had to start delegating, pivoting, and implementing features while also making sure to
        listen to feedback. While this might sound like common sense, it's deceptively difficult to champion for
        going BACK to features and improving or fixing them as a result of user feedback or general quality. By
        leveraging data as much as possible with tangible and quantitative information proved to be incredibly valuable
        when advocating for incremental changes.</p>

      <p>Discovery Education has a strong reputation for providing high quality content to classrooms and through our
        research we began to notice a trend of users not being aware of content we tested or spoke about. Some users
        were not engaging with a significant part of the Discovery Education experience due to the fact that they
        weren’t aware of many of the features. We addressed this problem in a number of ways.

      </p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Community Blogs</h5>
      <p>Working with the Community and Social Media team, we created a series of blog posts and community dicussions

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Always Available Support</h5>
      <p>By incorporating third party tools we were able to offer contextual help to the users based on what they were
        doing or had selected. In addition, help menus were contextual to the current experience, saving users some
        time when looking for help.
      </p>
      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Persistent and Progressive In-product Messaging</h5>
      <p>As we identified particular pain-points and gaps in feature engagement, we created a conversation with users

      <p class="span-col-12">Since Studio had to integrate with every product actively, our success metrics were
        composed of a taxonomy
        structure. Each goal had a value and each product had a value as well that attributed to the goals worth.

        At the top of the structure was performance, satisfaction, and business goals. Performance was one of the more
        challenging goals to align with due to the fact that much of what we were doing hadn't been done on the web
        prior,

          (DEN)
          Community is where teachers can go to discuss anything that's on their mind. We created a sub-community just
          for
          Studio where we had constant feedback and access to users, which also helped in reducing recruitment costs.

        eventually. This is where strategy and alignment really helped to support the process.


        <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Look and Feel</h5>
        <p>I instituted the visual direction including interactions, states, and design system integration. Studio
          leverages a touch-first interface that allows for an accessible and consistent experience regardless of
          device.

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Product Strategy and Alignment</h5>
      <p>
        As a product grows, so does the visibility of it internally and the transition from 100% production work to a
        split of selling, validating, and discussing caught us somewhat off-guard a little bit. Having more time and
        additional
        help with production work would have helped in keeping the company informed, engaged, and aligned on
        expectations.

      <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Pivoting away from solutions too quickly</h5>
      <p>
        More than once we turned back to older work, sometimes over a year old, to help solve problems, or sometimes to
        even
        become new features or product functionality. A small team is great, but sometimes the fast moving and high
        energy pace can hinder in-depth looks at experience when we see new and shiney solutions.
