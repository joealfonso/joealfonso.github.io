        <p class="projectSubhead">I was part of an ambitious effort to replace an old suite of tools with a solution
          that took advantage of modern web technologies in order to satisfy the needs a modern classroom for Discovery

        <p>DE Studio introduces a totally inclusive and accessible digital resource creation tool, in which users can
          create, edit, and organize content in order to collaborate, present, assess, and more. In what we call a
          "sandbox" type experience, we remove many of the traditional mental models of web and technology in order to
          allow and guide exploration and creation.
          We allow teachers and students to create digital content and designs called "Boards" by using resources from
          Discovery Education or their own content and media. What gets created is all up to the user. Examples are
          presentations, strategies, quizzes, polls, and planners. By allowing additional fucntionality beyond just
          classroom material and including live collaboration, we managed to significantly increased enagement with
          resources and even more so with the amount of sharing being done.

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> While still a capable tool, the current iteration of Discovery Education's design tool was built on outdated technology, sub-standard sharing models, and generally wasn't seen as the value driving product and core competency of the company it once was.
        </p>
        <p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Develop a product that leverages modern web technologies to create to most engaging, collaborative, and one of the most valuable tools in education technology. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>MY ROLE:</strong> I was Co-Product Designer and I lead User Experience team for Studio. I
          championed inclusive and accessible design principles, marketing and in-product messaging, and worked closely with the development team to iterate and develop testable prototypes into production ready solutions.

        <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
        <h4 class="projectSectionSubheading">Product Strategy and Alignment</h4>
        <p>Defining the vision, principles, goals and roadmap were critical in keeping daily work smooth and when
          communicating with other teams as the product matured.
          Making sure everyone understood and aligned towards a common goal and vision really does make a significant
          difference in
          over the course of a project.
        </p>

        <h4>Inclusive and Universal Design</h4>
        <p>Poor hardware, slow connections, increased security, and limited acces to technology a few of the challenges
          student and teachers face. We established a common baseline of performance that the experience had to meet or
          surpass. This is where Strategy and Alignment really support the process.

          <h4>Look and Feel</h4>
          <p>I instituted the visual direction including interactions, states, and design system integration. Studio
            leverages a touch-first interface that allows for an accessible and consistant experience regardless of
            device.

        <h2>High Concept</h2>
        <p>We set out with the goal to leverage innovative web technology in order to create a tool that allowed
          students and teachers to find, collect, create, and share all in the same place. In addition, real-time
          collaboration, group chat, and a full history of activity allows teachers a level of organization and control
          into project and lesson management.

          <h2>Not Your Typical Onboarding Experience</h2>
          <p>One of the key challenges when dealing with education is the fact that every teacher comes with their own mental models and literal education models that they have adapted and intepreted. A "writing prompt" might mean 4 different things to 4 different teachers. There's always overlap, but many time ciritcal pieces and adjustments don't translate as well, and if a teacher isn't aware adjsutmentsw

        <h2>Market and User Research</h2>
        <p> Studio was essentially a design application for education. This type of tool isn't uncommon, but it's certainly not a standardized experience either. Much of the research for native software isn't written about in high volume, and since it's so new to the web, most research is based on traditional web experience. Not progressive web applications and the specifics of them at the time of the project. 
          Using metrics like time on task, success rate, ciritcal and minor errors, we were able to establish a usability standard for user performance and satisfaction.

        <h2>The Final Product</h2>
        <p>Teachers and students have come up with their own custom ways of finding, saving, editing, and distributing
          content to compensate for the lack of a cohesive tool that can satisfy these core needs. While everyone does
          it
          their own way, it all boils down to finding a tool that is capable of collecting, editing, and sharing
          content. Then it they
          need to use the tool to share it. The tool now needs to speak to something else, many times an obscure
          internal
          tool. If it does allow for direct sharing, what type of sharing does it allow for? Can you send to multiple
          students at once? How customizable is the recipients list? Does the recipient have to do anything? Do they
          need
          an account? Does the district allow it?

        <h2>Performance and Satisfaction</h2>
        <p>Since Studio had to integrate with every product actively, our success metrics were composed of a taxonomy
          structure. Each goals had a value and each product had a value as well that attributed to the goals worth.

          At the top of the structure was performance, satisfaction, and business goals. Performance was one of the more
          challenging goals to align with due to the fact that much of what we were doing wasn’t done on the web prior,
          and we had to have checkpoints at different points of scale.

          Products that were retired as a result of Studio, often became indicators of key functionality. Tracking and
          data were retained and adjusted as needed for the new environment.

          While I helped with technical and performance monitoring when relevant, my actual responsibility was
          establishing, obtaining, and monitoring satisfaction and usability performance. By continually running
          research
          studies both internally and externally, we were able to keep a handle what were the key issues currently, and
          what might become something significant. Paired with quick iterative design, we were able to pivot and change
          quickly during the early development stages. Never getting too far off of what the business and users wanted.

        <h2>Supporting Success</h2>
        <p>SaaS launches are a little different in the education market. We were limited by a few factors. Two critical
          challenges were district contracts and the other being general user behavior dictates that most of the time
          teachers are tasked based in their use cases. They don’t have time to stop and learn a new product most days.
          And if they do, it’s mostly on their own time outside of specific training sessions.
        </p>
        <p>A products success is not fully defined by successful usability and being able to complete tasks. It’s a
          popular belief that products shouldn’t require any instruction and that it should just work, but that’s just
          not
          possible on certain products, especially when it’s a non-traditional experience. —you need good ui, functional
          and attractive interface, user engagement, marking

          Working with the marketing, copy-writing, content, and email distribution teams, we created a campaign that
          supported the initial discovery phase of research, managing to create a healthy user-base that created
          ownership
          very early on. Working across media channels such as Discovery Educators Network (DEN), discussing and
          presenting in person at conferences.

        <h2>The Future of the Product and Scalability</h2>
        <p>With scalability built into the fundamental framework of Studio, the future is bright. With over 10,000
          concurrent users at maximum load, Studio has held up relatively well. We still have issue with things such as
          icons loading in poorly and not showing up, but overall, they’re down to quality of life issues. We’re looking
          to the future with the component type elements Studio is based around. We have ideas and explorations with VR,

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">What Makes Studio So Special?</h2>
        <h4>Tangible Real-Time Collaboration</h4>
        <p>Not only do we allow users to work together, but you can actually see who is doing what as their cursor
          moves on your screen. We wanted to create a living space that users shared and worked on together. It’s one
          thing to pass a document back and fourth, it’s another to update it live, and it’s even ANOTHER thing when
          you can actually see what someone else is doing as if they were in the same physical space.

          I used tools like After Effects and principle to design much of the collaborative experience. Due to the
          nature of our collaboration being real-time and simultaneous, much of the intent and behavior required
          motion and interactions to be created and conducted in order to test, and get a sense of how these advanced
          features might feel, prior to investing heavily into any one method.</p>


        <h4>Optimization and Modern Technology</h4>
        <p>Leveraging new web technologies, we’re able to provide an extremely optimized and equal experience to each
          user. If our products and features fail our low-end device tests, then the whole task fails and we then set
          in to optimize and decide. Everyone student deserves the same opportunity to learn</p>

        <h4>Tracking and History</h4>
        <p>Each Studio board has its own history, and everyone in that board has their own participation history.
          This
          is big for a few reasons. First, it helps teachers track participation and facilitates pro-active
          participation. Secondly, having a history allows version control so nothing is lost. In addition, with a
          playback feature, we allow the users to see, over time, how the project has evolved and grown. Thirdly,
          and
          arguably most important, is the fact that since the teachers can see how students build, behave and edit,
          we
          look forward to being able to identify cognitive issues in new ways.n.

        <h4>A Sharing Model for the Modern Classroom</h4>
        <p>Teachers and students have come up with their own custom ways of finding, saving, editing, and distributing
          content to compensate for the lack of a cohesive tool that can satisfy these core needs. While everyone does
          it
          their own way, it all boils down to finding a tool that is capable of collecting, editing, and sharing
          content. Then it they
