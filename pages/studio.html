     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Summary</h2>
     <p>While still a capable tool, the current iteration of Discovery Education's design tool, Board Builder, was
       built on outdated technology, sub-standard sharing models, and generally wasn't seen as the value driving
       product and core competency of the company it once was. Competing products and companies had reshaped the
       education technology industry enough to require Discovery to rethink the user discovery, creation, and sharing
       model through a new strategy.
     </p>
     <p>We were developing a product that leverages modern web technologies to create one of the most engaging,
       collaborative, and innovative experiences in education technology. Using years of research it was discovered
       that all teachers generally had the same discovery, collection, and sharing model. Using this model we created
       a solution that served as centralized experience for students and teachers to engage with resources and each
       other more collaboratively.

     <p>
       As Product Designer and Lead User Experience designer my role was to advocate for both the user and the
       business while delegating, planning, and delivering production ready solutions. At the end of the day my job
       was to help lead the team to solve problems and ship high quality, user-friendly product that helps students
       and teachers. I managed to do that by working with a team of very talented, hard working, cooperative, and
       intelligent people.
     </p>
 
     <p>
       Part of making a product like Studio successful and moving forward with innovative ideas is by making a safe,
       diverse, and conducive environment. By working with the development team we created a live, and most
       importantly, easy to access development environment where anyone on the product team could start exploring.

   <div class="content">
     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Introducing Discovery Education Studio</h2>
     <p>Teachers and students have come up with their own custom ways of finding, saving, editing, and distributing
       content to compensate for the lack of a cohesive tool that can satisfy these core needs. In what we call a
       "sandbox" type experience, we remove many of the traditional mental models of web and technology in order to
       allow and guide exploration and creation.
     </p>
     <img src="../images/studio/BoardsMock1.png" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes" class="projectImage " />
 
     <p>
 
       We allow teachers and students to create digital content and designs called "Boards" by using resources from
       Discovery Education or their own content and media. What gets created is all up to the user. Examples are
       presentations, strategies, quizzes, polls, and planners. By allowing additional functionality beyond just
       classroom material and including live collaboration, we managed to significantly increased engagement with
       resources and even more so with the amount of sharing being done.
     </p>
   </div>

 <section class="wrapper wrapperGrey" id="whatDoesItDo">
   <div class="content">
     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">What does studio do exactly?</h2>
     <p>Yes... Everything... Kind of... The experience Studio offers has been described in many ways, a design tool,
       a creation tool, lesson planning tool and so on. We like to call it a design tool that offer a "sandbox" type
       experience where we remove many of the traditional models of web and technology in order to allow the user to
       craft their own experience and use the tool to solve the problems they're likely to encounter within the
       classroom.
     </p>
     <p>
       It's difficult to describe such an open experience, because you don't want to determine how someone uses it.
       If you wanted to make a class announcement you could use Studio. Creating a poster for a school event? Studio.
       Lesson plan for the next chapter in biology? Studio. Social media images and content? Studio. Memes? Oh you
       bet you can do that in Studio.
     </p>
     <p>
       Teachers and students have taken THE content, and their own, and use Studio in ways within the classroom, that
       never stop surprising us. Sometimes students will print them out and other times we've seen teachers and
       students use it for personal work too.
     </p>
   </div>

 <section class="wrapper " id="newModel">
   <div class="content">
     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">A NEW MODEL FOR CLASSROOMS</h2>
     <p>One of the significant motivating factors when exploring the initial ideas of Discovery Education's Studio
       was understanding how teachers to organize, edit, and share content. Through research lead by Geoffrey
       Robertson, we were able to discover that due to a number of reasons, most teachers would save the desired
       content in a variety of ways ranging from self emails with a filter system, sorted offline thumb drives, to
       any number of services.

     <p class="projectCaption">Behavior Model of Digital Resource Management</p>
     <p class="imageAbove">
       <p>Teachers are extremely hard-working, resourceful, and determined. Many times with little to no complaints
         we've seen teachers use products in completely unintended and unique ways in order to get them to facilitate
         their goals. Understanding why and how lead us to really focus on the sharing, invitation, and distribution
         of content.</p>

 <section class="wrapper wrapperGrey" id="researchPlanExplore">

     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Research, Plan, Explore, and Align</h2>
     <p>Leveraging previous research we were able to identify user frustrations, desires, and behaviors we
       established a taxonomy of goals and benefits that were important to a successful product. These goals served
       as guiding principles for the project living in creative briefs and user personas.
     </p>
     <p>Being able to unify the organization and agree on the vision, benefits, and core competencies of Studio
       served as an essential part of making intelligent and valuable use of time on meetings, reviews and planning.
       Disagreements are common and essential to progress, but when everyone understands the greater vision and goal,
       decisions are easier to make.

     <p class="projectCaption"> That's me on the left.</p>
 
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Leveraging personas </h5>
     <p>Given that so much can be done with Studio as a result of the open design experience, the number of variables
       per task, per goal, and per means to get to those goals we large in number. I addressed this by establishing
       personas that had specific and significant touch-points with tangible goals.

 <section class="wrapper " id="establishingGoals">
   <div class="content">
     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Establishing and measuring goals</h2>
     <p>Using traditional metrics like time on task, success rate, critical and minor errors, in addition to a few
       contextual metrics, we were able to establish a usability standard for user performance and satisfaction.
       Engagement with certain functionality was traced to make sure users were aware and able to take full
       advantage of the experience. Certain flows that the product it was replacing (Board Builder) such as sharing,
       adding elements, creating pages and so fourth were tracked and measured as well.
     </p>
     <p>Measuring against Board Builder allowed us to test significantly more than just product performance. It also
       created the opportunity to measure engagement with the rest of the site. Studio is where all of the
       exploring, reading, and collecting of resources teachers and students are required to do, end up. There's not
       much to do with a URL within a classroom unless supplemented with a tool, and Studio enables the additional
       engagement.

 <section class="wrapper wrapperGrey" id="earlyExploration">
   <div class="content">
     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Early exploration</h2>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Understanding the problem and solution</h5>
     <p>Right from the start we had an idea for the type of functionality users wanted. It's common to be a little
       off target at first and we were. While I was developing the initial prototypes, I went to the extreme and
       emulated what was a full editing tool. Most users will tell you they want as much customization as possible.
       The CONCEPT seems great, but in the end, users need a customization system that's out of the way when it's not
       needed while also being available and contextual when it is needed.

     <p>Right from the start we had an idea for the type of functionality users wanted. It's common to be a little

       needed while also being available and contextual when it is needed.
     </p>
     <p>Initially our prototypes were way too detailed and offered too much control all at once. It worked for the
       enthusiast or professional, but not for students and teachers.
     </p>

     <p class="projectCaption">Early Studio Dashboard designs</p>
     <p>Ultimately students and teachers want something easy to use. Teachers want to deliver content and students
       want to submit and share. Everyone wants to create though. In order to make Studio genuinely engaging to all
       users it had to look good and feel good. We addressed the looking good part by introducing a complex system of
       themes that were fully accessible and systematically diverse.
     </p>
   </div>

 <section class="wrapper " id="stayingFocused">
   <div class="content">
     <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Staying focused on Key features</h2>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Accessible themes</h5>
     <p>Not everyone checks for accessibility when they create things and that's ok. We also understand that color
       accessibility is extremely important in classrooms in order to provide equivalent experience and opportunities
       to all students. I personally went through and crafts a number of themes that retained accessible text and
       offered customizable backgrounds.
     </p>
     <img src="../images/studio/3colorThemes.png" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes" class="projectImage " />
 
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Guided customization</h5>
     <p>Users will almost always say they want more customization options when asked. Why not? Right? With every
       added element of customization you also increase the complexity of the system. What we started out with in the
       image above was too much for most users.
     </p>
     <img src="../images/studio/GuidedCustomization.png" aria-label="Initial elements panel prototypes" class="projectImage " />
 
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Tangible Real-Time Collaboration</h5>
     <p>Not only do we allow users to work together, but you can actually see who is doing what as their cursor
       moves on your screen. We wanted to create a living space that users shared and worked on together. It’s one
       thing to pass a document back and forth, it’s another to update it live, and it’s even ANOTHER thing when
       you can actually see what someone else is doing as if they were in the same physical space.</p>
 
     <p> I used tools like After Effects and principle to design much of the collaborative experience. Due to the
       nature of our collaboration being real-time and simultaneous, much of the intent and behavior required
       motion and interactions to be created and conducted in order to test, and get a sense of how these advanced
       features might feel, prior to investing heavily into any one method.</p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Optimization and Modern Technology</h5>
     <p>Leveraging new web technologies, we’re able to provide an extremely optimized and equal experience to each
       user. If our products and features fail our low-end device tests, then the whole task fails and we then set
       in to optimize and decide. Every student deserves the same opportunity to learn</p>
 
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Tracking and History</h5>
     <p>Each Studio board has its own history, and everyone in that board has their own participation history.
       This
       is big for a few reasons. First, it helps teachers track participation and facilitates pro-active
       participation. Secondly, having a history allows version control so nothing is lost. In addition, with a
       playback feature, we allow the users to see, over time, how the project has evolved and grown. Thirdly,
       and
       arguably most important, is the fact that since the teachers can see how students build, behave and edit,
       we
       look forward to being able to identify cognitive issues in new ways.n.

     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Launch plan</h5>
     <p>Working with stakeholders, management, and the marketing team we established a progressive launch plan that
       spanned about 14 months. This allowed the team, product, and community to all grow together resulting in a
       really transparent and strong relationship. </p>
     <p>Aligning with the school year limits how and when we can launch. With a soft launch before summer we could get
       in a significant amount of production level testing without critical consequences. This also allowed us to
       increase marketing and awareness campaigns. </p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Optimization and feature timeline</h5>
     <p>Once launched we then had to start delegating, pivoting, and implementing features while also making sure to
       listen to users. This sounds like common sense and it might be, but it's deceptively difficult to champion for
       going BACK to features and improving or fixing them as a result of user feedback or general quality. By
       leveraging data as much as possible with tangible and quantitative information proved to be incredibly valuable
       when advocating for incremental changes.</p>

     <p>Discovery Education has a solid reputation for providing high quality content to classrooms but after enough
       research we noticed a trend of users not being aware of content we tested or spoke about. More than a few
       users were not engaging with a significant part of the Discovery Education experience since they weren't even
       aware any of it existed. We addressed this problem in a number of ways.

     <p>The marketplace accomplished 2 main goals. One, it served as a starting point where teachers could save some

     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Community Blogs</h5>
     <p>Working with the Community and social media team, we made sure to write a series of blog posts based around

       time when looking for help.
     </p>
     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Persistent and Progressive In-product Messaging</h5>
     <p>As we identified particular pain-points and gaps in feature engagement, we created a conversation with users

       structure. Each goal had a value and each product had a value as well that attributed to the goals worth.
 
       At the top of the structure was performance, satisfaction, and business goals. Performance was one of the more
       challenging goals to align with due to the fact that much of what we were doing wasn’t done on the web prior,

       As a product grows, so does the visibility of it internally and the transition from 100% production work to a

       help with production work would have helped in keeping the company informed, engaged, and aligned on

     <h5 class="sectionSubHead">Pivoting away from solutions too quickly</h5>
     <p>
       More than once we turned back to older work, sometimes over a year old, to help solve problems, or sometimes even
       become new features or product functionality. A small team is great, but sometimes the fast moving and high
       energy pace can hinder in-depth looks at experience when we see new and shioney solutions.
