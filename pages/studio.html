        <p class="projectSubhead">I was part of an ambitious effort to replace an old suite of tools with a solution
          that took advantage of modern web technologies in order to satisfy the needs a modern classroom for Discovery
          Education (DE).

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Summary</h2>
         <p>While still a capable tool, the current iteration of Discovery Education's design tool, Board Builder, was built on outdated technology, sub-standard sharing models, and generally wasn't seen as the value driving product and core competency of the company it once was. Competing products and companies had reshaped the education technology industry enough to require Discovery to rethink the user discovery, creation, and sharing model through a new strategy. 
        </p>
        <p>We were developing a product that leverages modern web technologies to create one of the most engaging, collaborative, and innovative experiences in education technology. Using years of research it was discovered that all teachers generally had the same discovery, collection, and sharing model. Using this model we created a solution that served as centralized experience for students and teachers to engage with resources and each other more collaboratively.
        </p>
        <p>
       As Product Designer and Lead User Experience designer my role was to guide the research, design, and development of Studio. I championed inclusive and accessible design principles, marketing and in-product messaging, and worked closely with the development team to iterate and develop testable prototypes into production ready solutions. As a result of having the opportunity to be a part of Studio since its inception, I've been able to be a major part of the development, launch, support strategy, and marketing efforts.

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">What does studio do exactly?</h2>
        <p>Yes... Everything... Kind of... The experience Studio offers has been described in many ways, a design tool, a creation tool, lesson planning tool and so on. We like to call it a design tool that offer a "sandbox" type experience where we remove many of the traditional models of web and technology in order to allow the user to craft their own experience and use the tool to solve the problems they're likely to encounter within the classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's difficult to describe such an open experience, because you don't want to determine how someone uses it. If you wanted to make a class announcement you could use Studio. Creating a poster for a school event? Studio. Lesson plan for the next chapter in biology? Studio. Social media images and content? Studio. Memes? Oh you bet you can do that in Studio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachers and students have taken DE content, and their own, and use Studio in ways within the classroom, that never stop surprising us. Sometimes students will print them out and other times we've seen teachers and students use it for personal work too.

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">A NEW MODEL FOR CLASSROOMS</h2>
        <p>One of the significant motivating factors when exploring the initial ideas of Discovery Education's Studio was understanding how teachers find, save, organize, and share content. Through research lead by Geoffrey Robertson, we were able to discover that due to a number of reasons, most teachers would save the desired content in a variety of ways ranging from self emails with a filter system, to sorted offline thumb drives, to any number of services.

        <p class="projectCaption">Behavior Model of Digital Resource Management</p>
        <p class="imageAbove">
          <p>Teachers are extremely hard-working, resourceful, and determined. Many times with little to no complaints we've seen teacher use products in completely unintended and unique ways we hadn't ever thought of as a result of limited to no options in regards to how they transfer media and content. Understanding why and how lead us to really focus on the sharing, invitation, and distribution of content.</p>

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Research, Plan, Explore, and Align</h2>
        <p>Leveraging previous research we were able to identify user frustrations, desires, and behaviors we established a taxonomy of goals and benefits that were important to a successful product. These goals served as guiding principles for the project living in creative briefs and user personas.
        </p>
        <p>Being able to unify the organization and agree on the vision, benefits, and core competencies of Studio served as an essential part of making intelligent and valuable use of time on meetings, reviews and planning. Disagreements are common and essential to progress, but when everyone understands the greater vision and goal, decisions are easier to make.

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Establishing and measuring goals</h2>
        <p>Using traditional metrics like time on task, success rate, criitcal and minor errors, in addition to a few contextual metrics, we were able to establish a usability standard for user performance and satisfaction. This allowed us to measure decisions and changes, but it also provided a way to compare user behavior to the soon to be replaced product, Board Builder.
        </p>
        <p>Measuring against Board Builder allowed us to test significantly more than just direct product performance. It also created the opportunity to measure enagagement with the rest of the site. Studio is where all of the exploring, reading, and collecting of resources teachers and students are required to do, end up. There's not much to do with a URL within a classroom unless supplemented with a tool, and Studio enables the additional engagement.

        <h2>Supporting users and improving Product literacy</h2>
        <p>Discovery Education has a solid reputation for providing high quality content to classrooms but after enough research we noticed a trend of users not being aware of content we tested or spoke about. More than a few users were not engaging with a significant part of the Discovery Education experience since they weren't even aware any of it existed. We addressed this problem in a number of ways.
        </p>
        <h5>The Template Marketplace</h5>
        <p>The marketplace accomplished 2 main goals. One, it served as a starting point where teachers could save some tinme. Two, it demonstrated how others used boards which helped us get users to that "AHA!" moment.
        </p>
        <h5>Community Blogs</h5>
        <p>Working with the Community and social media team, we made sure to write a series of blog posts based around the mosmt popular features, frustrations, and any particular pain points.
        </p>
        <h5>Always Available Support</h5>
        <p>By incorporating third party tools we were able to offer contextual help to the users based on what they were doing or had selected. In addition, help menus were contextual to the current exprience, saving users some time when looking for help.
        </p>
        <h5>Persistant and Progressive In-product Messaging</h5>
        <p>As we identified particular pain-points and gaps in feature engagement, we created a conversation with users with tool-tips, tours, prompts, and opportunities for feedback.

        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading ">The Final Product</h2>
        <p>Teachers and students have come up with their own custom ways of finding, saving, editing, and distributing
          content to compensate for the lack of a cohesive tool that can satisfy these core needs. While everyone does
          it
          their own way, it all boils down to finding a tool that is capable of collecting, editing, and sharing
          content. Then it they
          need to use the tool to share it. The tool now needs to speak to something else, many times an obscure
          internal
          tool. If it does allow for direct sharing, what type of sharing does it allow for? Can you send to multiple
          students at once? How customizable is the recipients list? Does the recipient have to do anything? Do they
          need
          an account? Does the district allow it?

    <section class="wrapper wrapperGrey">
      <div class="content">
        <h2 class="projectSectionHeading">Performance and Satisfaction</h2>
        <p>Since Studio had to integrate with every product actively, our success metrics were composed of a taxonomy
          structure. Each goals had a value and each product had a value as well that attributed to the goals worth.

          At the top of the structure was performance, satisfaction, and business goals. Performance was one of the more
          challenging goals to align with due to the fact that much of what we were doing wasn’t done on the web prior,
          and we had to have checkpoints at different points of scale.

          Products that were retired as a result of Studio, often became indicators of key functionality. Tracking and
          data were retained and adjusted as needed for the new environment.

          While I helped with technical and performance monitoring when relevant, my actual responsibility was
          establishing, obtaining, and monitoring satisfaction and usability performance. By continually running
          research
          studies both internally and externally, we were able to keep a handle what were the key issues currently, and
          what might become something significant. Paired with quick iterative design, we were able to pivot and change
          quickly during the early development stages. Never getting too far off of what the business and users wanted.

        <h2>The Future of the Product and Scalability</h2>
        <p>With scalability built into the fundamental framework of Studio, the future is bright. With over 10,000
          concurrent users at maximum load, Studio has held up relatively well. We still have issue with things such as
          icons loading in poorly and not showing up, but overall, they’re down to quality of life issues. We’re looking
          to the future with the component type elements Studio is based around. We have ideas and explorations with VR,

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">What Makes Studio So Special?</h2>
        <h4>Tangible Real-Time Collaboration</h4>
        <p>Not only do we allow users to work together, but you can actually see who is doing what as their cursor
          moves on your screen. We wanted to create a living space that users shared and worked on together. It’s one
          thing to pass a document back and fourth, it’s another to update it live, and it’s even ANOTHER thing when
          you can actually see what someone else is doing as if they were in the same physical space.

          I used tools like After Effects and principle to design much of the collaborative experience. Due to the
          nature of our collaboration being real-time and simultaneous, much of the intent and behavior required
          motion and interactions to be created and conducted in order to test, and get a sense of how these advanced
          features might feel, prior to investing heavily into any one method.</p>


        <h4>Optimization and Modern Technology</h4>
        <p>Leveraging new web technologies, we’re able to provide an extremely optimized and equal experience to each
          user. If our products and features fail our low-end device tests, then the whole task fails and we then set
          in to optimize and decide. Everyone student deserves the same opportunity to learn</p>

        <h4>Tracking and History</h4>
        <p>Each Studio board has its own history, and everyone in that board has their own participation history.
          This
          is big for a few reasons. First, it helps teachers track participation and facilitates pro-active
          participation. Secondly, having a history allows version control so nothing is lost. In addition, with a
          playback feature, we allow the users to see, over time, how the project has evolved and grown. Thirdly,
          and
          arguably most important, is the fact that since the teachers can see how students build, behave and edit,
          we
          look forward to being able to identify cognitive issues in new ways.n.
        </p>

        <h4>A Sharing Model for the Modern Classroom</h4>
        <p>Teachers and students have come up with their own custom ways of finding, saving, editing, and distributing
          content to compensate for the lack of a cohesive tool that can satisfy these core needs. While everyone does
          it
          their own way, it all boils down to finding a tool that is capable of collecting, editing, and sharing
          content. Then it they
          need to use the tool to share it. The tool now needs to speak to something else, many times an obscure
          internal
          tool. If it does allow for direct sharing, what type of sharing does it allow for? Can you send to multiple
          students at once? How customizable is the recipients list? Does the recipient have to do anything? Do they
          need
          an account? Does the district allow it?

        <h2>Additional Contributions</h2>
        <h4 class="projectSectionSubheading">Product Strategy and Alignment</h4>
        <p>Defining the vision, principles, goals and roadmap were critical in keeping daily work smooth and when
          communicating with other teams as the product matured.
          Making sure everyone understood and aligned towards a common goal and vision really does make a significant
          difference in
          over the course of a project.
        </p>

        <h4>Inclusive and Universal Design</h4>
        <p>Poor hardware, slow connections, increased security, and limited acces to technology a few of the challenges
          student and teachers face. We established a common baseline of performance that the experience had to meet or
          surpass. This is where Strategy and Alignment really support the process.

          <h4>Look and Feel</h4>
          <p>I instituted the visual direction including interactions, states, and design system integration. Studio
            leverages a touch-first interface that allows for an accessible and consistant experience regardless of
            device.

        <p>DE Studio introduces a totally inclusive and accessible digital resource creation tool, in which users can
          create, edit, and organize content in order to collaborate, present, assess, and more. In what we call a
          "sandbox" type experience, we remove many of the traditional mental models of web and technology in order to
          allow and guide exploration and creation.
          We allow teachers and students to create digital content and designs called "Boards" by using resources from
          Discovery Education or their own content and media. What gets created is all up to the user. Examples are
          presentations, strategies, quizzes, polls, and planners. By allowing additional fucntionality beyond just
          classroom material and including live collaboration, we managed to significantly increased enagement with
          resources and even more so with the amount of sharing being done.

        <h2>Supporting Success</h2>
        <p>SaaS launches are a little different in the education market. We were limited by a few factors. Two critical
          challenges were district contracts and the other being general user behavior dictates that most of the time
          teachers are tasked based in their use cases. They don’t have time to stop and learn a new product most days.
          And if they do, it’s mostly on their own time outside of specific training sessions.

        <p>A products success is not fully defined by successful usability and being able to complete tasks. It’s a
          popular belief that products shouldn’t require any instruction and that it should just work, but that’s just
          not
          possible on certain products, especially when it’s a non-traditional experience. —you need good ui, functional
          and attractive interface, user engagement, marking

          Working with the marketing, copy-writing, content, and email distribution teams, we created a campaign that
          supported the initial discovery phase of research, managing to create a healthy user-base that created
          ownership
          very early on. Working across media channels such as Discovery Educators Network (DEN), discussing and
